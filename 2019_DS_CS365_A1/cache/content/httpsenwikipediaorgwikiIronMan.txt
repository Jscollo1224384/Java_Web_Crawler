concealing his true identity Stark eventually declared that he was in fact Iron Man in a public announcement Initially Iron Man was a vehicle for Stan Lee to explore Cold War themes particularly the role of American technology and industry in the fight against communism Subsequent re imaginings of Iron Man have transitioned from Cold War motifs to contemporary matters of the time Throughout most

External links Publication history Further information List of Iron Man titles Premiere Iron Man s Marvel Comics premiere in Tales of Suspense cover dated March was a collaboration among editor and story plotter Stan Lee scripter Larry Lieber story artist Don Heck and cover artist and character designer Jack Kirby In Lee had been toying with the idea of a businessman superhero He wanted to create the quintessential capitalist a character that would go against the spirit of the times and Marvel s readership Lee said I think I gave myself a dare It was the height of the Cold War The readers the young readers if there was one thing they hated it was war it was the military So I got a hero who represented that to the hundredth degree He was a weapons manufacturer he was providing weapons for the Army he was rich he was an industrialist I thought it would be fun to take the kind of character that nobody would like none of our readers would like and shove him down their throats and make them like him And he became very popular He set out to make the new character a wealthy glamorous ladies man but one with a secret that would plague and torment him as well Writer Gerry Conway said Here you have this character who on the outside is invulnerable I mean just can t be touched but inside is a wounded figure Stan made it very much an in your face wound you know his heart was broken you know literally broken But there s a metaphor going on there And that s I think what made that character interesting Lee based this playboy s looks and personality on Howard Hughes explaining Howard Hughes was one of the most colorful men of our time He was an inventor an adventurer a multi billionaire a ladies man and finally a nutcase Without being crazy he was Howard Hughes Lee said While Lee intended to write the story himself a minor deadline emergency eventually forced him to hand over the premiere issue to Lieber who fleshed out the story The art was split between Kirby and Heck He designed the costume Heck said of Kirby because he was doing the cover The covers were always done first But I created the look of the characters like Tony Stark and his secretary Pepper Potts In a interview when asked if he had a specific model for Tony Stark and the other characters Heck replied No I would be thinking more along the lines of some characters I like which would be the same kind of characters that Alex Toth liked which was an Errol Flynn type Iron Man first appeared in to page stories in Tales of Suspense which featured anthology science fiction and supernatural stories The character s original costume was a bulky gray armored suit replaced by a golden version in the second story issue April It was redesigned as sleeker red and golden armor in issue Dec by that issue s interior artist Steve Ditko although Kirby drew it on the cover As Heck recalled in T he second costume the red and yellow one was designed by Steve Ditko I found it easier than drawing that bulky old thing The earlier design the robot looking one was more Kirbyish In his premiere Iron Man was an anti communist hero defeating various Vietnamese agents Lee later regretted this early focus Throughout the character s comic book series technological advancement and national defense were constant themes for Iron Man but later issues developed Stark into a more complex and vulnerable character as they depicted his battle with alcoholism as in the Demon in a Bottle storyline and other personal difficulties From issue Nov to its final issue March the anthological science fiction backup stories in Tales of Suspense were replaced by a feature starring the superhero Captain America Lee and Heck introduced several adversaries for the character including the Mandarin in issue Feb the Black Widow in April and Hawkeye five issues later Lee said that of all the comic books we published at Marvel we got more fan mail for Iron Man from women from females than any other title We didn t get much fan mail from girls but whenever we did the letter was usually addressed to Iron Man Lee and Kirby included Iron Man in The Avengers Sept as a founding member of the superhero team The character has since appeared in every subsequent volume of the series Writers have updated the war and locale in which Stark is injured In the original story it was the Vietnam War In the s it was updated to be the first Gulf War and in the s updated again to be the war in Afghanistan Stark s time with the Asian Nobel Prize winning scientist Ho Yinsen is consistent through nearly all incarnations of the Iron Man origin depicting Stark and Yinsen building the original armor together One exception is the direct to DVD animated feature film The Invincible Iron Man in which the armor Stark uses to escape his captors is not the first Iron Man suit Themes The original Iron Man title explored Cold War themes as did other Stan Lee projects in the early years of Marvel Comics Where The Fantastic Four and The Incredible Hulk respectively focused on American domestic and government responses to the Communist threat Iron Man explored industry s role in the struggle Tony Stark s real life model Howard Hughes was a significant defense contractor who developed new weapons technologies Hughes was an icon both of American individualism and of the burdens of fame Historian Robert Genter in The Journal of Popular Culture writes that Tony Stark specifically presents an idealized portrait of the American inventor Where earlier decades had seen important technological innovations come from famous individuals e g Nikola Tesla Thomas Edison Alexander Graham Bell the Wright brothers the s saw new technologies including weapons being developed mainly by the research teams of corporations As a result little room remained for the inventor who wanted credit for and creative and economic control over his her own creations Issues of entrepreneurial autonomy government supervision of research and ultimate loyalty figured prominently in early Iron Man stories the same issues affecting American scientists and engineers of that era Tony Stark writes Genter is an inventor who finds motive in his emasculation as an autonomous creative individual This blow is symbolized by his chest wound inflicted at the moment he is forced to invent things for the purposes of others instead of just himself To Genter Stark s transformation into Iron Man represents Stark s effort to reclaim his autonomy and thus his manhood The character s pursuit of women in bed or in battle writes Genter represents another aspect of this effort The pattern finds parallels in other works of s popular fiction by authors such as Ian Fleming creator of James Bond Mickey Spillane Mike Hammer and Norman Mailer who made unregulated sexuality a form of authenticity Solo series After issue March the Tales of Suspense series was renamed Captain America An Iron Man story appeared in the one shot comic Iron Man and Sub Mariner April before the Golden Avenger made his solo debut with Iron Man May The series indicia gives its copyright title Iron Man while the trademarked cover logo of

Cover art by Jack Kirby and Don Heck Tales of Suspense Dec the debut of Iron Man s first red and gold suit of armor Cover art by Jack Kirby and Sol Brodsky Origins Anthony Edward Stark is the son of wealthy industrialist and head of Stark Industries Howard Stark and Maria Stark A boy genius he enters MIT at the age of to study engineering and later receives master s degrees in engineering and physics After his parents are killed in a car accident he inherits his father s company Stark is injured by a booby trap and captured by enemy forces led by Wong Chu Wong Chu orders Stark to build weapons but Stark s injuries are dire and shrapnel is moving towards his heart His fellow prisoner Ho Yinsen a Nobel Prize winning physicist whose work Stark had greatly admired during college constructs a magnetic chest plate to keep the shrapnel from reaching Stark s heart In secret Stark and Yinsen use the workshop to design and construct a suit of powered armor which Stark uses to escape During the escape attempt Yinsen sacrifices his life to save Stark s by distracting the enemy as Stark recharges Stark takes revenge on his kidnappers and rejoins the American forces on his way meeting a wounded American Marine fighter pilot James Rhodey Rhodes Back home Stark discovers that the shrapnel fragment lodged in his chest cannot be removed without killing him and he is forced to wear the armor s chestplate beneath his clothes to act as a regulator for his heart He must recharge the chestplate every day or else risk the shrapnel killing him The cover story that Stark tells the news media and general public is that Iron Man is his robotic personal bodyguard and corporate mascot To that end Iron Man fights threats to his company e g Communist opponents Black Widow the Crimson Dynamo and the Titanium Man as well as independent villains like the Mandarin who becomes his greatest enemy No one suspects Stark of being Iron Man as he cultivates a strong public image of being a rich playboy and industrialist Two notable members of the series supporting cast at this point are his personal chauffeur Harold Happy Hogan and secretary Virginia Pepper Potts to both of whom he eventually reveals his dual identity Meanwhile James Rhodes finds his own niche as Stark s personal pilot ultimately revealing himself to be a man of extraordinary skill and daring in his own right The series took an anti Communist stance in its early years which was softened as public and therefore presumably reader opposition rose to the Vietnam War This change evolved in a series of storylines featuring Stark reconsidering his political opinions and the morality of manufacturing weapons for the U S military Stark shows himself to be occasionally arrogant and willing to act unethically in order to let the ends justify the means This leads to personal conflicts with the people around him both in his civilian and superhero identities Stark uses his vast personal fortune not only to outfit his own armor but also to develop weapons for S H I E L D other technologies e g Quinjets used by the Avengers and the image inducers used by the X Men Eventually Stark s heart condition is resolved with an artificial heart transplant s and early s Stark expands on his armor designs and begins to build his arsenal of specialized armors for particular situations such as for space travel and stealth Stark also develops a serious dependency on alcohol in the Demon in a Bottle storyline The first time it becomes a problem is when Stark discovers that the national security agency S H I E L D has been buying a controlling interest in his company in order to ensure Stark s continued weapons development for them At the same time it is revealed that several minor supervillains armed with advanced weapons who had bedeviled Stark throughout his superhero career are in fact in the employ of Stark s business rival Justin Hammer who begins to plague Stark more directly At one point in Hammer s manipulations the Iron Man armor is taken over and used to murder a diplomat Although Iron Man is not immediately under suspicion Stark is forced to hand the armor over to the authorities Eventually Stark and Rhodes who is now his personal pilot and confidant track down and defeat those responsible although Hammer would return to bedevil Stark again With the support of his then girlfriend Bethany Cabe his friends and his employees Stark pulls through these crises and overcomes his dependency on alcohol Even as he recovers from this harrowing personal trial Stark s life is further complicated when he has a confrontation with Doctor Doom that is interrupted by an opportunistic enemy sending them back in time to the time of King Arthur Once there Iron Man thwarts Doom s attempt to solicit the aid of Morgan Le Fay and the Latverian ruler swears deadly vengeance to be indulged sometime after the two return to their own time This incident was collected and published as Doomquest Some time later a ruthless rival Obadiah Stane manipulates Stark emotionally into a serious relapse As a result Stark loses control of Stark International to Stane becomes a homeless alcoholic vagrant and gives up his armored identity to Rhodes who becomes the new Iron Man Eventually Stark recovers and joins a new startup Circuits Maximus Stark concentrates on new technological designs including building a new set of armor as part of his recuperative therapy Rhodes continues to act as Iron Man but steadily grows more aggressive and paranoid due to the armor not having been calibrated properly for his use Eventually Rhodes goes on a rampage and Stark has to don a replica of his original armor to stop him Fully recovered Stark confronts Stane who has himself designed armor based on designs seized along with Stark International dubbing himself the Iron Monger Defeated in battle Stane rather than give Stark the satisfaction of taking him to trial commits suicide Shortly thereafter Stark regains his personal fortune but decides against repurchasing Stark International until much later he instead creates Stark Enterprises headquartered in Los Angeles Late s and s In an attempt to stop other people from misusing his designs Stark goes about disabling other armored heroes and villains who are using suits based on the Iron Man technology the designs of which were stolen by his enemy Spymaster His quest to destroy the stolen technology originally called Stark Wars but is more commonly known as the Armor Wars severely hurts his reputation as Iron Man After attacking and disabling a series of minor villains such as Stilt Man he attacks and defeats the government operative known as Stingray The situation worsens when Stark realizes that Stingray s armor does not incorporate any of his designs He publicly fires Iron Man while covertly pursuing his agenda He uses the cover story of wanting to help disable the rogue Iron Man to infiltrate and disable the armor of the S H I E L D operatives known as the Mandroids as well as the armor of the Guardsmen In the process Iron Man and Jim Rhodes allow some of the villains in the Vault to escape This leads the United States government to declare Iron Man a danger and an outlaw and severely sours Stark s relationship with Steve Rogers Captain America who was in his Captain persona at the time Iron Man travels to Russia where he inadvertently causes the death of the Soviet Titanium Man during a fight Returning to the U S he faces an enemy commissioned by the government named Firepower Unable to defeat him head on Stark fakes Iron Man s demise intending to retire the suit permanently When Firepower goes rogue Stark creates a new suit claiming a new person is in the armor Soon after Stark is nearly killed by Kathy Dare a mentally unbalanced former lover She shoots him dead center in his torso which injures his spine paralyzing him Stark undergoes special surgery to have a nerve chip implanted into his spine to regain his mobility Unbeknownst to the industrialist the nerve chip is a clandestine means by which to gain control over his body Rival businessmen the Marrs Twins and their cohort Kearson DeWitt are behind the machinations in what came to be known as Armor Wars II After several successful tests by DeWitt at manipulating Stark Tony finds that using his Encephalo Armor can counteract DeWitt s controls In response DeWitt suddenly releases his control resulting in excruciating agony throughout Stark s body The constant battle for control of Stark s nervous system and subsequent abdication on DeWitt s end lead to massive nerve damage throughout Tony s body Stark s nervous system continues its slide towards failure and he constructs a skin made up of artificial nerve circuitry to assist it Stark begins to pilot a remote controlled Iron Man armor but when faced with the Masters of Silence the telepresence suit proves inadequate Stark designs a more heavily armed version of the suit to wear the Variable Threat Response Battle Suit which becomes known as the War Machine armor Ultimately the damage to his nervous system becomes too extensive Faking his death Stark places himself in suspended animation to heal as Rhodes takes over both the running of Stark Enterprises and the mantle of Iron Man although he uses the War Machine armor Stark eventually makes a full recovery by using a chip to create an entirely new artificial nervous system and resumes as Iron Man in a new Telepresence Armor When Rhodes learns that Stark has manipulated his friends by faking his own death he becomes enraged and the two friends part ways Rhodes continues on as War Machine in a solo career The Avengers story arc The Crossing reveals Iron Man as a traitor among the team s ranks due to years of manipulation by the time traveling dictator Kang the Conqueror Stark as a sleeper agent in Kang s thrall kills Marilla the nanny of Crystal and Quicksilver s daughter Luna as well as Rita DeMara the female Yellowjacket then Amanda Chaney an ally of the Avengers The Avengers Forever limited series retcons these events as the work of a disguised Immortus not Kang and that the mental control had gone back only a few months Needing help to defeat both Stark and Kang the team travels back in time to recruit a teenaged Anthony Stark from an alternate timeline to assist them The young Stark steals an Iron Man suit in order to aid the Avengers against his older self The sight of his younger self shocks the older Stark enough for him to regain momentary control of his actions and he sacrifices his life to stop Kang The young Stark later builds his own suit to become the new Iron Man and remains in the present day During the battle with the creature called Onslaught the teenage Stark dies along with many other superheroes Franklin Richards preserves these dead heroes in the Heroes Reborn pocket universe in which Stark is once again an adult hero Franklin recreates the heroes in the pocket universe in the forms he is most familiar with rather than what they are at the present The reborn adult Stark upon returning to the normal Marvel Universe merges with the original Stark who had died during The Crossing but was resurrected by Franklin Richards This new Anthony Stark possesses the memories of both the original and teenage Anthony Stark and thus considers himself to be essentially both of them With the aid of the law firm Nelson Murdock he regains his fortune and with Stark Enterprises having been sold to the Fujikawa Corporation following Stark s death sets up a new company Stark Solutions He returns from the pocket universe with a restored and healthy heart After the Avengers reform Stark demands a hearing be convened to look into his actions just prior to the Onslaught incident Cleared of wrongdoing he rejoins the Avengers s At one point Stark s armor becomes sentient despite fail safes to prevent its increasingly sophisticated computer systems from doing so Initially Stark welcomes this living armor for its improved tactical abilities The armor begins to grow more aggressive killing indiscriminately and eventually desiring to replace Stark altogether In the final confrontation on a desert island Stark suffers another heart attack The armor sacrifices its own existence to save its creator s life giving up essential components to give Stark a new artificial heart This new heart solves Stark s health problems but it does not have an internal power supply so Stark becomes once again dependent on periodic recharging The sentient armor incident so disturbs Stark that he temporarily returns to using an unsophisticated early model version of his armor to avoid a repeat incident He dabbles with using liquid metal circuitry known as S K I N that forms into a protective shell around his body but eventually returns to more conventional hard metal armors During this time Stark engages in a romance with Rumiko Fujikawa a wealthy heiress and daughter of the man who had taken over his company during the Heroes Reborn period Her relationship with Stark endures many highs and lows including infidelity with Stark s rival Tiberius Stone in part because the fun loving Rumiko believes that Stark is too serious and dull Their relationship ends with Rumiko s death at the hands of an Iron Man impostor in Iron Man vol In Iron Man vol July Stark publicly reveals his dual identity as Iron Man not realizing that by doing so he has invalidated the agreements protecting his armor from government duplication since those contracts state that the Iron Man armor would be used by an employee of Tony Stark not by Stark himself When he discovers that the United States military is

superpowered individual in the U S to register their identity with the government and act as licensed agents The Act would force inexperienced superhumans to receive training in how to use and control their abilities something in which Tony strongly believes Since his struggle with alcoholism Stark has carried a tremendous burden of guilt after nearly killing an innocent bystander while piloting the armor drunk While Reed Richards and Dr Henry Hank Pym both agree with Stark s proposal not everyone does After Captain America is ordered to bring in anyone who refuses to register he and other

Danvers continues to use the visions as a resource Tony objects to the concept of profiling people This results in a stand off when Tony s side abducts a woman from custody after Ulysses visions identified her as a deep cover HYDRA agent despite the lack of supporting evidence Iron Man learns that his biological mother was actually Amanda Armstrong who had given him up for adoption and that

mantle of Iron Man to a year old girl named Riri Williams Riri is an MIT student who built her own Iron Man suit out of scrap pieces and as such attracted Stark s attention Early depictions of Williams suit depict it without the Arc Reactor but leaves the power source for the suit unclear Another Iron Man based series titled Infamous Iron Man debuted featuring Doctor Doom sporting his version of the Iron Man armor This is revealed to be the result of serious injuries sustained by Stark during his final confrontation with Captain Marvel Danvers beating leaves Stark in a coma but he

to Hydra and how he ended up like this As Hydra tightens its grip across America the Tony Stark A I leads a team known as the Underground to find the Cosmic Cubes to restore Rogers to his normal self When things start to escalate Tony and his crew go rogue and in search for answers for the Cube As Iron Man and the Underground search for them they are intercepted by Captain America and his Hydra team With both teams encountering each other they are captured by the Ultron Hank Pym hybrid who forces both teams to sit at a dinner table During dinner Ultron reveals information about the Hydra Avengers such as Odinson working with Hydra to reclaim Mjolnir Scarlet Witch being possessed by Chthon and Vision being affected by an A I virus Ultron argues that he is doing this because the Avengers have become less of a family over the years as so many of them jump to obey Captain America or Iron Man despite past experience confirming that this is not always a good idea but Tony counters that the only reason the team failed as a family was because of Hank s abuse towards Wasp Enraged Ultron is about to kill everyone but Ant Man is able to calm him down by arguing that Hank remains his own inspiration Ultron allows the Underground to leave with the fragment arguing that neither side should have an advantage over the other Back in America Hydra Supreme has put Namor in a position where he will be forced to sign a peace treaty that gives Rogers access to the Cosmic Cube fragment in Atlantis but Hydra Supreme muses that he is unconcerned about who will acquire the

updated Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information May Mary Jane Watson and other Stark employees find that Stark s body has completely vanished from its pod despite tests taken mere hours ago showing no sign of improvement or brain activity volume issue needed It was discovered that Tony Stark s comatose body was taken to the Stark Industries Complex in Dover Upon awakening when his biological systems rebooted Tony Stark went into hiding until he fully recovered Wanting to make sure that James Rhodes was in a similar state that he was in Tony Stark exhumed his body from Arlington Cemetery and kick started the biological systems in him Afterwards Iron Man and War Machine fought Hood to keep Stark Industries from falling into Hood s hands where he switched to a version of his Extremis armor Then he proceeded to defeat Jude when he turned up alive Powers abilities and equipment Armor Main article Iron Man s armor The Bleeding Edge Armor like the Extremis Armor before it is stored in Stark s bones and can be assembled and controlled by his thoughts Iron Man possesses powered armor that gives him superhuman strength and durability flight and an array of weapons The armor is invented and worn by Stark with occasional short term exceptions Other people who have assumed the Iron Man identity include Stark s long time partner and best friend James Rhodes close associates Harold Happy Hogan Eddie March briefly Michael O Brien and Riri Williams The weapons systems of the suit have changed over the years but Iron Man s standard offensive weapons have always been the repulsor rays that are fired from the palms of his gauntlets Other weapons built into various incarnations of the armor include the uni beam projector in its chest pulse bolts that pick up kinetic energy along the way so the farther they travel the harder they hit an electromagnetic pulse generator and a defensive energy shield that can be extended up to degrees Other capabilities include generating ultra freon i e a freeze beam creating and manipulating magnetic fields emitting sonic blasts and projecting dimensional holograms to create decoys In addition to the general purpose model he wears Stark has developed several specialized suits for space travel deep sea diving stealth and other special purposes Stark has modified suits like the Hulkbuster heavy armor The Hulkbuster armor is composed of add ons to his so called modular armor designed to enhance its strength and durability enough to engage the Hulk in a fight A later model created with the help of Odin and the Asgardian metal Uru is similar to the Destroyer Stark develops an electronics pack during the Armor Wars that when attached to armors that use Stark technologies will burn out those components rendering the suit useless This pack is ineffective on later models While it is typically associated with James Rhodes the War Machine armor began as one of Stark s specialty armors The most recent models of Stark s armor beginning with the Extremis armor are now stored in the hollow portions of Stark s bones and the personal area networking implement used to control it is implanted into his forearm and connected directly to his central nervous system The Extremis has since been removed volume issue needed and he now uses more conventional armors Some armors still take a liquid form but are not stored within his body His Endo Sym Armor incorporates a combination of the liquid smart metal with the alien Venom symbiote psionically controlled by Stark Post Secret Wars Stark uses a more streamlined suit of armor that uses nanotechnology to shape shift into other armors or weapons Powers After being critically injured during a battle with the Extremis enhanced Mallen Stark injects his nervous system with modified techno organic virus like body restructuring machines the Extremis process By rewriting his own biology Stark is able to save his life gain an enhanced healing factor and partially merge with the Iron Man armor superseding the need for bulky AI controlled armors in favor of lighter designs technopathically controlled by his own brain His enhanced technopathy extends to every piece of technology limitless and effortlessly due to his ability to interface with communication satellites and wireless connections to increase his range Some components of the armor sheath are now stored in Tony s body able to be recalled and extruded from his own skin at will During the Secret Invasion storyline the Extremis package is catastrophically shut down by a virus forcing him again to rely on the previous iteration of his armor and restoring his previous limitations Furthermore Osborn s takeover of most of the few remaining Starktech factories with Ezekiel Stane systematically crippling the others limits Tony to the use of lesser older and weaker armors After being forced to wipe out his brain to prevent Norman Osborn from gaining his information Tony Stark is forced to have a new arc reactor of Rand design installed in his chest The process greatly improves his strength stamina and intellect The procedure left him with virtually no autonomic functions as his brain was stripped of every biological function Tony is forced to rely on a digital backup of his memories leaving him with severe gaps and lapses in his long term memory and on software routine in the arc reactor for basic stimuli reaction such as blinking and breathing The Bleeding Edge package of armor and physical enhancement is now equal in power if not a more advanced version of the old Extremis tech Skills Tony Stark is an inventive genius whose expertise in the fields of mathematics physics chemistry and computer science rivals that of Reed Richards Hank Pym and Bruce Banner and his expertise in electrical engineering and mechanical engineering surpasses even theirs He is regarded as one of the most intelligent characters in the Marvel Universe He graduated with advanced degrees in physics and engineering at the age of from Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT and further developed his knowledge ranging from artificial intelligence to quantum mechanics as time progressed His expertise extends to his ingenuity in dealing with difficult situations such as difficult foes and deathtraps in which he is capable of using available tools including his suit in unorthodox but effective ways He is well respected in the business world able to command people s attention when he speaks on economic matters having over the years built up several multimillion dollar companies from virtually nothing He is noted for the loyalty he commands from and returns to those who work for him as well as for his business ethics Thus he immediately fired an employee who made profitable but illegal sales to Doctor Doom He strives to be environmentally responsible in his businesses At a time when Stark was unable to use his armor for a period he received some combat training from Captain America and has become physically formidable on his own when the situation demands it In addition Stark possesses great business and political acumen On multiple occasions he reacquired control of his companies after losing them amid corporate takeovers Due to his membership in the Illuminati Iron Man was given the Space Infinity Gem to safeguard It
