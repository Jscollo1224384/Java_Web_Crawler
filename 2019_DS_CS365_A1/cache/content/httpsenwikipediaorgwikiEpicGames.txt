References External links History Potomac Computer Systems Potomac Computer Systems was founded by Tim Sweeney in At the time Sweeney was studying mechanical engineering at the University of Maryland Though he lived in a dorm located in Potomac Maryland he frequently visited his parents who lived in the same town where his personal computer used for both work and leisure was situated Out of this location Sweeney started Potomac Computer Systems as a computer consulting business but later figured that it would be too much work he would have to put into keeping the business stable and scrapped the idea After finishing his game ZZT in October Sweeney opted to re use the Potomac Computer Systems name to release the game to the public It was only with the unexpected success of ZZT caused in most part by the easy modifiability of the game using Sweeney s custom ZZT oop programming language that made Sweeney consider turning Potomac Computer Systems into a video game company ZZT was sold through bulletin board systems while all orders were fulfilled by Sweeney s father Paul Sweeney The game sold several thousand copies as of May and Paul Sweeney still lived at the former Potomac Computer Systems address at the time fulfilling all orders that eventually came by mail The final copy of ZZT was shipped by Paul Sweeney in November Epic MegaGames Epic Games founder Tim Sweeney In early Sweeney found himself and his new found video game company in a business where larger studios such as Apogee Software and id Software were dominant and he had to find a more serious name for his As such Sweeney came up with Epic MegaGames a name which incorporated Epic and Mega to make it sound like it represented a fairly large company such as Apogee Software although he was its only employee Sweeney soon underwent searching for a business partner and eventually caught up with Mark Rein who previously quit his job at id Software and moved to Toronto Ontario Rein worked remotely from Toronto and primarily handled sales marketing and publishing deals business development that Sweeney found to have significantly contributed to the company s growth Some time this season the company soon had employees consisting of programmers artists designers and composers Among them was the year old Cliff Bleszinski who joined the company after submitting his game Dare to Dream to Sweeney The following year they had over employees In Epic MegaGames produced a shareware isometric shooter called Fire Fight developed by Polish studio Chaos Works It was published by Electronic Arts By Epic MegaGames had people working for them worldwide In Epic MegaGames released Unreal a D first person shooter co developed with Digital Extremes which expanded into a series of Unreal games The company also began to license the core technology the Unreal Engine to other game developers Epic Games present Unreal and personal computer gaming A statue of Unreal s Malcolm at Epic Games headquarters In February Epic MegaGames announced that they had moved their headquarters to a new location in Cary North Carolina and would henceforth be known as simply Epic Games Rein explained that Unreal was first created by developers who were scattered across the world eventually the team came together to finish the game and that s when the real magic started The move to North Carolina centralizes Epic bringing all of the company s talented developers under one roof Furthermore Sweeney stated that the Mega part of the name was dropped because they no longer wanted to pretend to be a big company as was the original intention of the name when it was a one man team The follow up game Unreal Tournament shipped to critical acclaim the same year at which point the studio had employees The company launched the Make Something Unreal competition in aiming to reward video game developers who create mods using the Unreal game engine Tripwire Interactive won US in cash and computer hardware prizes over the course of the contest in the first contest in Gears of War and console gaming Around the personal computer video game market was struggling with copyright infringement in the form of software piracy and it became difficult to make single player games elements which had been part of Epic s business model to that point The company decided to shift focus into developing on console systems a move which Sweeney called the start of the third major iteration of the company Epic In Epic released the Xbox shooter Gears of War which became a commercial success for the company grossing about US million off a US million budget A year later the company released Unreal Tournament for PC and acquired a majority share in People Can Fly In Epic Games acquired Utah based Chair Entertainment and released Gears of War selling over three million copies within the first month of its release Summer saw the launch of Chair Entertainment s Shadow Complex an adventure game inspired by the Metroid series Epic Games released on September Epic Citadel as a tech demo to demonstrate the Unreal Engine running on Apple iOS within Adobe Flash Player Stage D and using HTML WebGL technologies It was also released for Android on January Epic Games worked on an iOS game Infinity Blade which was released on December The third game in the series Gears of War came out in In Epic s subsidiary Titan Studios was dissolved At the Spike Video Game Awards Epic Games announced their new game Fortnite In June Epic announced that it is opening up a new studio Epic Baltimore made up of members of Studios Big Huge Games Epic Baltimore was renamed to Impossible Studios in August However the studio ended up closing its doors in February Epic alongside People Can Fly made one last game in the Gears of War series that served as a prequel to the other games Gears of War Judgement which was released in At this point Epic had considered developing a fourth main title for Gears of War but estimated that its budget would be at least US million Additionally they had suggested the idea of a multiplayer only version of Gears of War that featured improved versions of maps based on user feedback similar to the concept behind Unreal Tournament but Microsoft rejected this idea Epic recognized the troubles of being held to the business objectives of a publisher and began to shift the company again Games as a Service and Tencent acquisition Play media An inside look at Epic Games Coupled with their desire to move away from being beholden to a publisher Epic Games observed that the video game industry was shifting to a games as a service model GaaS Sweeney stated There was an increasing realization that the old model wasn t working anymore and that the new model was looking increasingly like the way to go In an attempt to gain more GaaS experience they made an agreement with Chinese Tencent who had several games under their banner including Riot Games League of Legends operating successfully as games as a service In exchange for Tencent s help Tencent acquired approximately of Epic then issued share capital equating to of total Epic inclusive of both stock and employee stock options for million in June Tencent Holdings has the right to nominate directors to the board of Epic Games and thus counts as an associate of the Group However Sweeney stated that Tencent otherwise has very little control on the creative output of Epic Games Sweeney considered the partial acquisition by Tencent as the start of Epic the fourth major iteration of the company allowing the company to be more agile in the gaming marketplace Around this point Epic had about employees A number of high profile staff left the company months after the Tencent deal was announced for various reasons Some notable departures included Cliff Bleszinski then the design director announced he was leaving Epic Games in October after years with the company His official reason was It s time for a much needed break Bleszinski later stated that he had become jaded about the gaming industry in the lead up to Tencent s involvement After Tencent s investment Bleszinski attempted to renegotiate his contract but failed to come to terms making him think about retirement instead He opted to stop coming into work spending his time at his beach house eventually leading Sweeney to come down and have a heart to heart discussion with Bleszinski on the new direction Epic was going and asking him to make a firm decision regarding his commitment to Epic Bleszinski opted to write his resignation letter the next day After about two years Bleszinski started Boss Key Productions in President Mike Capps announced his retirement in December and cited the reasons as the arrival of a baby boy he was having with his wife and his plans to be a stay at home dad He subsequently announced his departure of his advisory role as well as his affiliation with the company in March Rod Fergusson who had been a lead developer for the Gears of War series left Epic in August Fergusson stated that he had seen the direction that the Tencent acquisition would have taken the company and was not interested in the free to play style of games but instead wanted to continue developing a AAA big narrative big story big impact game Fergusson briefly joined Irrational Games owned by K Games to help complete BioShock Infinite While there Fergusson talked with K about potentially continuing the Gears of War series leading to talks between K Games Epic and Microsoft As a result Microsoft acquired the rights to Gears of War on January eventually assigned those to Microsoft Game Studios Fergusson moved to Black Tusk Studios owned by Microsoft Game Studios to take on lead development for a new Gears title with the studio being rebranded as The Coalition The first game since the acquisition Gears of War was released in October Adrian Chmielarz the founder of People Can Fly and who joined Epic when his studio was acquired earlier in decided to leave after Tencent s acquisition stating that he and other former People Can Fly members did not believe the free to play games as a service direction fit their own personal vision or direction they wanted to go Chmielarz and these others left Epic in late to form The Astronauts Lee Perry a lead designer on both Unreal and Gears of War series who felt that Epic has started to grow too large to maintain a role as an eccentric game developer Coupled with the studio s need for more management to support the games as a service model Perry felt that their creative freedom would become limited He and five other senior people left Epic to form a new studio Bitmonster Epic continued on its goal to deliver games as a service following these departures Fortnite was to serve as their testbed for living games but with the shifts in staff as well as shifting its engine from Unreal Engine to its release suffered some setback Epic started additional projects the free to play and community developed Unreal Tournament first announced in and the free to play multiplayer online battle arena game Paragon launched in for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation Epic also released a remastered version of Shadow Complex for newer consoles and computers in and their first foray into virtual reality with the release of Robo Recall for the Oculus Rift The investment infusion from Tencent allowed Epic Games to relicense the Unreal Engine engine in March to be free for all users to develop with with Epic taking royalties on games developed with the engine In June Epic agreed to allow Epic Games Poland depart the company and sold its shares in the studio the studio reverted to their former name People Can Fly The Bulletstorm IP

play title across computer console and mobile platforms Fortnite Battle Royale quickly gained an audience amassing over million players by May with estimates of having earned over US billion by July through microtransactions including its battle pass system Epic Games which had been valued at around US million at the time of Tencent s acquisition was estimated to be worth US billion in July due to Fortnite Battle Royale and expected to surpass US billion by the end of with projected growth of the game Player count continued to expand when Epic broke new ground by convincing Sony to change its stance on cross platform play allowing players on any device to compete with each other in Fortnite Battle Royale Fortnite has drawn nearly million players as of March Fornite s commercial success enabled Epic to make several changes to its other product offerings In July it reduced the revenue cut that it took for assets sold on the Unreal Engine Marketplace from to Epic launched the Epic Games Store digital storefront to compete with services like Steam and GOG com not only taking only a cut of revenue compared to the industry standard of but also eliminated the cut for games using the Unreal engine sold via the storefront However the company also refocused its development efforts to provide more support for Unreal and Fortnite by ending support for Paragon and Unreal Tournament The financial success of Fortnite brought additional investment into Epic Games Epic Games was one of eleven companies selected to be part of the Disney Accelerator program in providing Epic equity investment and access to some of Disney s executives and potential opportunity to work with Disney in the future Disney had selected both Epic and aXiomatic as potential leads in the growing esports arena Epic announced in October that it had acquired US billion in investment from seven firms KKR ICONIQ Capital Smash Ventures aXiomatic Vulcan Capital Kleiner Perkins and Lightspeed Venture Partners The firms join Tencent Disney and Endeavor as minority shareholders in Epic which is still controlled by Sweeney With the investment Epic Games was estimated to have a nearly US billion

provide a working game engine causing the Ontario based game developer to experience considerable losses The suit alleged that Epic Games was sabotaging Unreal Engine licensees Epic s licensing document stated that a working version of the engine would be available within six months of the Xbox developer kits being released Silicon Knights claimed that Epic not only missed this deadline but that when a working version of the engine was eventually released the documentation was insufficient The game studio also claimed Epic had withheld vital improvements to the game engine claiming they were game specific while also using licensing fees to fund the development of its own titles rather than the engine itself In August Epic Games counter sued Silicon Knights alleging the studio was aware when it signed on that certain features of Unreal Engine were still in development and that components would continue to be developed and added as Epic completed work on Gears of War Therefore in a statement Epic said that SK knew when it committed to the licensing agreement that Unreal Engine may not meet its requirements and may not be modified to meet them Additionally the counter suit claimed that Silicon Knights had made unauthorized use of Epic s Licensed Technology and had infringed and otherwise violated Epic s intellectual property rights including Epic s copyrighted works trade secrets know how and confidential information by incorporating Unreal Engine code into its own engine the Silicon Knights Engine Furthermore Epic asserted the Canadian developer broke the contract when it employed this derivative work in an internal title and a second game with Sega a partnership for which it never received a license fee On May Epic Games defeated Silicon Knights lawsuit and won its counter suit for million on grounds of copyright infringement misappropriation of trade secrets and breach of contract an injury award that was later doubled due to prejudgment interest attorneys fees and costs Consistent with Epic s counterclaims the presiding judge James C Dever III stated that Silicon Knights had deliberately and repeatedly copied thousands of lines of Epic Games copyrighted code and then attempted to conceal its wrongdoing by removing Epic Games copyright notices and by disguising Epic Games copyrighted code as Silicon Knights own Dever stated that evidence against Silicon Knights was overwhelming as it not only copied functional code but also non functional internal comments Epic Games programmers had left for themselves As a result on November Silicon Knights was directed by the court to destroy all game code derived from Unreal Engine all information from licensee restricted areas of Epic s Unreal Engine documentation website and to permit Epic Games access to the company s servers and other devices to ensure these items have been removed In addition the studio was instructed to recall and destroy all unsold retail copies of games built with Unreal Engine code including Too Human X Men Destiny The Sandman The Box Ritualyst and Siren in the Maelstrom the latter three titles were projects never released or even officially announced On May Silicon Knights filed for bankruptcy and a Certificate of Appointment was issued by the office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy with Collins Barrow Toronto Limited being appointed as trustee in
