Captain America Comics cover dated March from Timely Comics a predecessor of Marvel Comics Captain America was designed as a patriotic supersoldier who often fought the Axis powers of World War II and was Timely Comics most popular character during the wartime period The popularity of superheroes waned following the war and the Captain America comic book was discontinued in with a short lived revival in Since Marvel Comics revived the character in Captain America has remained in publication The character wears a costume bearing an American flag motif and he utilizes a nearly indestructible shield which he throws as a projectile Captain America is the alter ego of Steve Rogers a frail young man enhanced to the peak of human perfection by an experimental serum to aid the United States government s efforts in World War II Near the end of the war he was trapped in ice and survived in suspended animation until he was revived in the present day Although Captain America often struggles to maintain his ideals as a man out of his time with its modern realities he remains a highly respected figure in his community which includes becoming the long time leader of the Avengers Captain

In writer Joe Simon conceived the idea for Captain America and made a sketch of the character in costume I wrote the name Super American at the bottom of the page Simon said in his autobiography and then decided No it didn t work There were too many Supers around Captain America had a good sound to it There weren t a lot of captains in comics It was as easy as that The boy companion was simply named Bucky after my friend Bucky Pierson a star on our high school basketball team Simon recalled in his autobiography that Timely Comics publisher Martin Goodman gave him the go ahead and directed that a Captain America solo comic book series be published as soon as possible Needing to fill a full comic with primarily one character s stories Simon did not believe that his regular creative partner artist Jack Kirby could handle the workload alone I didn t have a lot of objections to putting a crew on the first issue There were two young artists from Connecticut that had made a strong impression on me Al Avison and Al Gabriele often worked together and were quite successful in adapting their individual styles to each other Actually their work was not too far from that of Kirby s If they worked on it and if one inker tied the three styles together I believed the final product would emerge as quite uniform The two Als were eager to join in on the new Captain America book but Jack Kirby was visibly upset You re still number one Jack I assured him It s just a matter of a quick deadline for the first issue I ll make the deadline Jack promised I ll pencil it all myself and make the deadline I hadn t expected this kind of reaction but I acceded to Kirby s wishes and it turned out was lucky that I did There might have been two Als but there was only one Jack Kirby I wrote the first Captain America book with penciled lettering right on the drawing boards with very rough sketches for figures and backgrounds Kirby did his thing building the muscular anatomy adding ideas and popping up the action as only he could Then he tightened up the penciled drawings adding detailed backgrounds faces and figures Comic Art Convention program featuring Simon s original sketch of Captain America Al Lieberman would ink that first issue which was lettered by Simon and Kirby s regular letterer Howard Ferguson Simon said Captain America was a consciously political creation he and Kirby were morally repulsed by the actions of Nazi Germany in the years leading up to the United States involvement in World War II and felt war was inevitable The opponents to the war were all quite well organized We wanted to have our say too Golden Age Captain America Comics cover dated March and on sale December a year before the attack on Pearl Harbor but a full year into World War II showed the protagonist punching Nazi leader Adolf Hitler it sold nearly one million copies While most readers responded favorably to the comic some took objection Simon noted When the first issue came out we got a lot of threatening letters and hate mail Some people really opposed what Cap stood for The threats which included menacing groups of people loitering out on the street outside of the offices proved so serious that police protection was posted with New York Mayor Fiorello La Guardia personally contacting Simon and Kirby to give his support Though preceded as a patriotically themed superhero by MLJ s The Shield Captain America immediately became the most prominent and enduring of that wave of superheroes introduced in American comic books prior to and during World War II as evidenced by the unusual move at the time of premiering the character in his own title instead of an anthology title first This popularity drew the attention and a complaint from MLJ that the character s triangular shield too closely resembled the chest symbol of their Shield character In response Goodman had Simon and Kirby create a distinctive round shield for issue which went on to become an iconic element of the character With his sidekick Bucky Captain America faced Nazis Japanese and other threats to wartime America and the Allies Stanley Lieber now better known as Stan Lee contributed to the character in issue in the filler text story Captain America Foils the Traitor s Revenge which introduced the character s use of his shield as a returning throwing weapon Captain America soon became Timely s most popular character and even had a fan club called the Sentinels of Liberty Circulation figures remained close to a million copies per month after the debut issue which outstripped even the circulation of news magazines such as Time during the period After the Simon and Kirby team moved to DC Comics in late having produced Captain America Comics through issue January Al Avison and Syd Shores became regular pencillers of the celebrated title with one generally inking over the other The character was featured in All Winners Comics Summer Fall Marvel Mystery Comics

Chester Phillips and Project Rebirth Rogers is used as a test subject for the Super Soldier project receiving a special serum made by Dr Josef Reinstein later retroactively changed to a code name for the scientist Abraham Erskine The serum is a success and transforms Steve Rogers into a nearly perfect human being with peak strength agility stamina and intelligence The success of the program leaves Erskine wondering about replicating the experiment on other human beings The process itself has been inconsistently detailed While in the original material Rogers is shown receiving injections of the Super Serum when the origin was retold in the s the Comic Code Authority had already put a veto over graphic description of drug intake and abuse and thus the Super Serum was retconned into an oral formula Erskine refused to write down every crucial element of the treatment leaving behind a flawed imperfect knowledge of the steps Thus when the Nazi spy Heinz Kruger killed him Erskine s method of creating new Super Soldiers died Captain America in his first act after his transformation avenges Erskine In the origin story and in Tales of Suspense Kruger dies when running into machinery but is

in hot pursuit The pair reaches the plane just before takeoff When Bucky tries to defuse the bomb it explodes in mid air Rogers is hurled into the freezing waters of the North Atlantic Both are presumed dead though it is later revealed that neither had died Late s to s Captain America appeared in comics for the next few years changing from World War II era hero fighting the Nazis to confronting the United States newest enemy Communism The revival of the character in the mid s was short lived and events during that time period are later retconned to show that multiple people

Burnside was a history graduate enamored with the Captain America mythos having his appearance surgically altered to resemble Rogers and legally changing his name to Steve Rogers becoming the new s Captain America He administered to himself and his pupil James Jack Monroe a flawed incomplete copy of the Super Serum which made no mention about the necessary Vita Ray portion of the treatment As a result while Burnside and Monroe became the new Captain America and Bucky they became violently paranoid often raving about innocent people being communist sympathizers during the height of the Red

to kill the Red Skull He then reveals that he has Baron Zemo in a cell planning to recruit him He eventually kills the Skull after the villain is captured by the Unity Squad and the Xavier brain fragment extracted by the Beast Rogers throwing the Skull out of a window over a cliff after Sin and Crossbones affirm their new allegiance to Rogers In the Secret Empire storyline Rogers as the head of S H I E L D uses a subsequent alien invasion and a mass supervillain assault in order to seize control of the United States He neutralizes the superheroes that might oppose him and seeks the Cosmic Cube to bring about a reality in which Hydra won World War II When Rick smuggles information about the Cube s rewriting of Rogers reality to the remaining free Avengers a disheveled bearded man in a torn World War II army uniform appears who introduces himself as Steve Rogers As the Avengers and Hydra search for fragments of the shattered Cube it is revealed that this amnesic Steve Rogers is actually a manifestation of Rogers existing within the Cube itself created by Kobik s memories of Rogers before he was converted to Hydra as she comes to recognize that her decision to rewrite Rogers as an agent of Hydra was wrong Although Hydra Rogers is able to mostly reassemble the Cosmic Cube Sam Wilson and Bucky are able to use a fragment of the cube to restore the memory of pre Hydra Rogers in the Cube to corporeal existence allowing him to defeat his Hydra self subsequently using the Cube to undo most of the damage caused by Hydra manipulating reality even if the physical damage remains Hydra Cap continues to exist as a separate entity and is kept trapped in a prison where he is the only inmate mocking the restored Rogers about the challenge he will face rebuilding his reputation even as Rogers muses that this experience will teach everyone not to place such blind trust in another Powers and abilities Steve Rogers physical transformation from a reprint of Captain America Comics March Art and story by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby Tactician and field commander Rogers battle experience and training make him an expert tactician and an excellent field commander with his teammates frequently deferring to his orders in battle The Avengers X Men Fantastic Four and other heroes choose Rogers as their leader during the Secret Wars Thor says that Rogers is one of the very few mortals he will take orders from and follow through the gates of Hades Rogers reflexes and senses are extraordinarily keen He has blended Aikido Boxing Judo Karate Jujutsu Kickboxing and gymnastics into his own unique fighting style and is a master of multiple martial arts Years of practice with his near indestructible shield make him able to aim and throw it with almost unerring accuracy His skill with his shield is such that he can attack multiple targets in succession with a single throw or even cause a boomerang like return from a throw to attack an enemy from behind In canon he is regarded by other skilled fighters as one of the best hand to hand combatants in the Marvel Universe limited only by his human physique Although the super soldier serum is an important part of his strength Rogers has shown himself still sufficiently capable against stronger opponents even when the serum has been deactivated reverting him to his pre Captain America physique Stan Lee claimed that he d always been fascinated by the fact that although Captain America has the least spectacular super power of all the mantle of leadership falls naturally upon him as though he was born to command Cap is one of the hardest hero characters to write because the writer cannot use some exotic super power to make his episodes seem colorful All he has to serve him are his extraordinary combat skills his shield and his unquenchable love for freedom and justice Rogers has vast U S military knowledge and is often shown to be familiar with ongoing classified Defense Department operations He is an expert in combat strategy survival acrobatics parkour military strategy piloting and demolitions Despite his high profile as one of the world s most popular and recognizable superheroes Rogers has a broad understanding of the espionage community largely through his ongoing relationship with S H I E L D Super Soldier Serum Steve Rodgers is often considered to be the pinnacle of human potential and operates at peak physical performance due to his enhancement via the Super Soldier Serum The Super Soldier Serum enhances all of his metabolic functions and prevents the build up of fatigue poisons in his muscles giving him endurance far in excess of an ordinary human being This accounts for many of his extraordinary feats including bench pressing pounds kg as a warm up and running a mile km in less than a minute mph km h nearly twice the maximum speed achieved by the best human sprinters Furthermore his enhancements are the reason why he was able to survive being frozen in suspended animation for decades He is highly resistant to hypnosis or gases that could limit his focus The secrets of creating a super soldier were lost with the death of its creator Dr Abraham Erskine In the ensuing decades there have been numerous attempts to recreate Erskine s treatment only to have them end in failure Even worse the attempts have instead often created psychopathic supervillains of which Captain America s s imitator and Nuke are the most notorious examples Weapons and equipment Further information Captain America s shield Captain America s shield Captain America has used multiple shields throughout his history the most prevalent of which is a nigh indestructible disc shaped shield made from an experimental alloy of steel and the fictional vibranium The shield was cast by American metallurgist Dr Myron MacLain who was contracted by the U S government from orders of President Franklin D Roosevelt to create an impenetrable substance to use for tanks during World War II This alloy was created by accident and never duplicated although efforts to reverse engineer it resulted in the discovery of adamantium Captain America often uses his shield as an offensive throwing weapon The first instance of Captain America s trademark ricocheting shield toss occurs in Stan Lee s first comics writing the two page text story Captain America Foils the Traitor s Revenge in Captain America Comics May The legacy of the shield among other comics characters includes the time traveling mutant superhero Cable telling Captain America that his shield still exists in one of the possible futures Cable carries it into battle and brandishes it as a symbol When without his trademark shield Captain America sometimes uses other shields made from less durable metals such as steel or even a photonic energy shield designed to mimic a vibranium matrix Rogers having relinquished his regular shield to Barnes carried a variant of the energy shield which can be used with either arm and used to either block attacks or as an improvised offensive weapon able to cut through metal with relative ease Much like his Vibranium shield the energy shield can be thrown including ricocheting off multiple surfaces and returning to his hand Captain America s uniform is made of a fire retardant material and he wears a lightweight bulletproof duralumin scale armor beneath his uniform for added protection Originally Rogers mask was a separate piece of material but an early engagement had it dislodged thus almost exposing his identity To prevent a recurrence of the situation Rogers modified the mask with connecting material to his uniform an added benefit of which was extending his armor to cover his previously exposed neck As a member of the Avengers Rogers has an Avengers priority card which serves as a communications device Captain America has used a custom specialized motorcycle modified by the S H I E L D weapons laboratory as well as a custom built battle van constructed by the Wakanda Design Group with the ability to change its color for disguise purposes red white and blue and fitted to store and conceal the custom motorcycle in its rear section with a frame that allows Rogers to launch from the vehicle riding it Antagonists Main article List of Captain America enemies Captain America has faced numerous foes in over years of published adventures Many of his recurring foes embody ideologies contrary to the American values that Captain America is shown to strive for and believes in Some examples of these opposing values are Nazism Red Skull Baron Zemo neo Nazism Crossbones Doctor Faustus technocratic fascism AIM Arnim Zola Communism Aleksander Lukin amoral capitalism Roxxon Energy Corporation anarchism Flag Smasher and
