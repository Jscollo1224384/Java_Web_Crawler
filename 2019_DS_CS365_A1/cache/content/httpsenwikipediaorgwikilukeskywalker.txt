merged into this article Discuss Proposed since July Legends comic books Luke Skywalker appears in the Marvel published Star Wars comics adaptations of the original trilogy as well as an ongoing series that ran from When Dark Horse acquired the license two years later he appeared in numerous projects based on the franchise as well In Star Wars Legacy set years after the events of the original films Luke appears as a spirit in the Force to his descendant Cade Skywalker and persuades him to once again become a Jedi in order to defeat the evil Darth Krayt and his burgeoning Sith empire Legends video games An older and wiser Luke Skywalker also appears in the Jedi Knight II Jedi Outcast and Jedi Knight Jedi Academy video games at the rank of Jedi Master In Jedi Outcast Luke helps Kyle Katarn in his fight against Desann and Empire Reborn by driving them away from the Valley of the Jedi Luke appears in the game Star Wars The Force Unleashed in an alternate storyline DLC where Starkiller duels Luke He also appears in the Disney LucasFilm video game Star Wars Commander Luke is also a playable character in Disney Infinity Characterization Psychoanalytic Each of the Star Wars characters instantiates one of the archetypes in Joseph Campbell s Hero s journey with Luke Skywalker symbolizing the Hero archetype As such he is a formulaic relatable protagonist who encounters the basic struggle between good and evil in the same way as other heroic figures such as Harry Potter Bilbo Baggins and Jesus Christ Luke s central dilemma is the ongoing war between good and evil both externally and internally Like most protagonists emerging from this storytelling formula Luke is not raised by his biological parents Religious Some argue that Luke mirrors fundamental values of Christianity and Abrahamic religion Luke s journey is often compared to that of Jesus Christ Scholars argue that Luke is a Christ like figure while Yoda represents a god and Darth Vader represents the temptations of evil Luke s struggle between good and evil is contrasted with that of his father Anakin Skywalker in a way that represents the story of the Prodigal Son Concept and creation In initial drafts of the Star Wars script Luke Skywalker was called Luke Starkiller at one point featuring in the title The Star Wars From the Adventures of Luke Starkiller The character was variously designed as a year old grizzled war hero later as a Jedi Master and as a woman The Starkiller surname remained for the first few months of production Hamill on camera used the name Luke Starkiller the sole time he referred to himself during filming dubbed Skywalker in the film Starkiller was dropped due to what Lucas called unpleasant connotations with Charles Manson In an interview about his early drafts Lucas said The first version talked about a princess and an old general The second version involved a father his son and his daughter the daughter was the heroine of the film Now the daughter has become Luke Mark Hamill s character There was also the story of two brothers where I transformed one of them into a sister The older brother was imprisoned and the young sister had to rescue him and bring him back to their dad An alternative ending pitched by George Lucas for Return of the Jedi was Luke assuming his father s role as Darth Vader after the latter s death and intending to rule in his place Though Lawrence Kasdan favored the idea Lucas ultimately declined since the films were made for children Another conclusion to the film featured the character disappearing into the wilderness akin to Clint Eastwood in the spaghetti westerns During the filming of the original Star Wars trilogy George Lucas informed Hamill that he would be needed to reprise the role when he was middle aged Lucas further explained that his role as Luke would be handing Excalibur to the next generation Hamill had no reaction at the time as he thought of making Star Wars films decades in the future as an abstract concept Hamill learned of the sequel trilogy over the summer of at a Star Wars Celebration during lunch when Lucas told him one was in development Hamill recalled shaving his beard to portray the Trickster in The Flash then letting it grow back for the filming of Star Wars Luke s lack of screen time in The Force Awakens was due to concerns by screenwriter Michael Arndt that his presence would mean the audience would have less interest in protagonist Rey leading to an agreement that he be removed from the screen and instead become a plot device Hamill attended meetings for script readings and helped conceal Luke s role in the film instead of dialogue he read stage directions Abrams said it allowed him to remain involved and that his reading helped make a better experience for everyone According to concept designer Christian Alzmann Luke s appearance in The Last Jedi was partly inspired by that of Colonel Kurtz in Apocalypse Now Reception In Luke Skywalker was selected by Empire magazine as the th greatest movie character of all time Empire also ranked him as the third greatest Star Wars character Luke was also on the ballot for the American Film Institute s Years Heroes and Villains On their list of the Greatest Fictional Characters Fandomania com ranked Luke at number IGN listed Luke as their th top Star Wars character and he was chosen twice by IGN s readers as one of their favorite Star Wars characters IGN s Jesse Schedeen also picked Luke Skywalker as one of the characters they most wanted to appear on the Wii as well as listing Skywalker as one of their favorite Star Wars heroes Schedeen also listed the character as one of the Star Wars characters they wanted to see in Soulcalibur IGN also called the fight between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader in Return of the Jedi one of the ultimate movie boss battles In a feature on speeches made by Luke Skywalker IGN s Todd Gilchrist said that his favorite speech made by Luke was I am a Jedi like my father before me UGO Networks listed Luke as one of their best heroes of all time and he was voted as one of the coolest Star Wars characters by UGO s readers Inventor Dean Kamen has also code named his new prosthetic arm system Luke in honor of the character WatchMojo ranked Luke Skywalker as on their Top Star Wars Characters list Mark Hamill was nominated a Saturn Award for Best Actor in for his portrayal of Luke Skywalker in Star Wars and won the award for his portrayal in The Empire Strikes Back Return of the Jedi and The Last Jedi In Mark Hamill had a serious car accident after filming Star Wars which involved an operation on his face It was speculated that the Wampa attack at the beginning of The Empire Strikes Back was written in to explain his facial injuries but George Lucas specifically disputed this in the DVD commentary of The Empire Strikes Back In regards to Luke s portrayal in The Last Jedi many fans expressed disappointment in how he was depicted as a grumpy old man whose failures had driven him into hiding a stark departure in how Luke was characterized in the original trilogy Hamill originally stated that he pretty much fundamentally disagreed with every choice The Last Jedi director Rian Johnson made for this character but that he had the utmost respect for Johnson and was willing to do his part to realize Johnson s vision While regarding the possibility of a younger actor playing the role Hamill expressed support towards Sebastian Stan whose physical resemblance to a young Hamill went viral However he noted that child actor Jacob Tremblay would be his top choice if the story were to be focused on a very young Luke In when asked about the character s sexual orientation and if Luke could be gay Hamill said Luke s sexual orientation is meant to be interpreted by the viewer He added if you think Luke is gay of course he is You should not be ashamed of it Judge Luke by his character not by who he loves Hamill later said that he considered the possibility that Luke could have found love between Episode VI and Episode VII Cultural impact Forty years after his first onscreen appearance Skywalker remains to be an American icon In fact Luke Skywalker is often still used by child psychotherapists to help children to project their thoughts and state of being in a way that is understandable to both the child and their therapist Another way that therapists utilize Star Wars in sessions is to teach their patients that the Force represents the self understanding that they achieve in therapy Children are taught that they are Luke and their therapist is Obi Wan as eventually as Luke no longer needed his mentor patients will one day no longer need their therapist Star Wars has been related back to cultural events of its time such as The Cold War and Nixon era politics The severing of Luke s hand and Darth Vader s bionic presence supposedly according to space com symbolize the unity of the military and amputees Family tree Main article Skywalker family v t e Skywalker family tree Aika Lars Cliegg Lars Shmi Skywalker n Jobal Naberrie n Ruwee Naberrie n Beru Whitesun Owen Lars Anakin
