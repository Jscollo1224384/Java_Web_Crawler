franchise The Star Wars franchise depicts the adventures of characters A long time ago in a galaxy far far away in which humans and many species of aliens often humanoid co exist with robots or droids who may assist them in their daily routines space travel between planets is common due to hyperspace technology A mystical power known as the Force is described in the original film as an energy field created by all living things that binds the galaxy together Through training and meditation those whom the Force is strong with are able to perform various superpowers such as telekinesis precognition telepathy and manipulation of physical energy The Force is wielded by two major knighthood orders at conflict with each other the Jedi peacekeepers of the Old Republic ruthlessly hunted by Imperial authorities who act on the light side of the Force through non attachment and arbitration and the Sith ancient enemies of the galactic democracy who use the dark side by manipulating fear and aggression While Jedi Knights can be numerous the Dark Lords of the Sith or Darths are intended to be limited to two a master and their apprentice Force wielders are very limited in numbers in comparison to the rest of the average population The Jedi and Sith prefer the use of a weapon called lightsaber which is the cylinder like hilt of a sword when turned off but when turned on ignites a laser blade that can cut through virtually any surface Fights between the two factions result in duels which are a mix between sword skills and the use of the Force The rest of the average population as well as renegades and soldiers use laser powered blaster firearms which Force users can deflect using lightsabers Fictional timeline The rises and falls of different regimes are chronicled throughout the saga which is split into three fictional eras The Age of Republic The era of the prequel trilogy in which the democratic Galactic Republic is corrupted by its Supreme Chancellor

the Empire is fought by the Rebel Alliance in a Galactic Civil War that spans several years climaxing with the apparent death of the Emperor The surviving Rebellion gives rise to the New Republic The original trilogy depicts the galaxy as dirty and grimy in George Lucas s depiction of a used universe The Age of Resistance The era of the sequel trilogy in which the remnants of the Empire reform as the First Order Heroes of the former rebellion lead the Resistance against the oppressive dictatorship Rather than depend on an overabundant use of computer generated imagery The Force Awakens

with references to its fictional universe deeply embedded in everyday life Phrases like evil empire and May the Force be with you have become part of the popular lexicon The first Star Wars film in was a cultural unifier enjoyed by a wide spectrum of people The film can be said to have helped launch the science fiction boom of the late s and early s making science fiction films a mainstream genre The widespread impact made it a prime target for parody works and homages with popular examples including Hardware Wars Spaceballs The Family Guy Trilogy and Robot Chicken Star Wars In the Library of Congress selected the original Star Wars film for preservation in the U S National Film Registry as being culturally historically or aesthetically significant The Empire Strikes Back was selected in mm reels of the Special Editions were the versions initially presented for preservation because of the difficulty of transferring from the original prints but it was later revealed that the Library possesses a copyright deposit print of the original theatrical releases Industry The original Star Wars film was a huge success for th Century Fox and was credited for reinvigorating the company Within three weeks of the film s release the studio s stock price doubled to a record high Prior to th Century Fox s greatest annual profits were million while in the company broke that record by posting a profit of million The franchise helped Fox to change from an almost bankrupt production company to a thriving media conglomerate Star Wars fundamentally changed the aesthetics and narratives of Hollywood films switching the focus of Hollywood made films from deep meaningful stories based on dramatic conflict themes and irony to sprawling special effects laden blockbusters as well as changing the Hollywood film industry in fundamental ways Before Star Wars special effects in films had not appreciably advanced since the s The commercial success of Star Wars created a boom in state of the art special effects in the late s Along with Jaws Star Wars started the tradition of the summer blockbuster film in the entertainment industry where films open on many screens at the same time and profitable franchises are important It created the model for the major film trilogy and showed that merchandising rights on a film could generate more money than the film itself did The original Star Wars trilogy is widely considered one of the best film trilogies in history Numerous filmmakers have been influenced by Star Wars including Damon Lindelof Dean Devlin Roland Emmerich John Lasseter David Fincher Joss Whedon John Singleton Kevin Smith and later Star Wars directors J J Abrams and Gareth Edwards Christopher Nolan cited Star Wars as an influence when making the blockbuster film Inception Lucas s concept of a used universe particularly influenced Ridley Scott s Blade Runner and Alien James Cameron s Aliens as well as The Terminator George Miller s Mad Max and Peter Jackson s The Lord of the Rings trilogy Regarding the return and expansion of the franchise Lawrence Kasdan noted that the spin offs were expanding the franchise into more of a shared universe beyond the previously linear saga adding that one of the strengths of the franchise was how it all fell under the same continuity in comparison to other franchises Kasdan also contrasted Star Wars to the Marvel Cinematic Universe noting that Star Wars features less comedy than the latter and adding that he felt a more comedic approach would not be Star Wars to him Film critic Roger Ebert wrote in his book The Great Movies Like The Birth of a Nation and Citizen Kane Star Wars was a technical watershed that influenced many of the movies that came after It began a new generation of special effects and high energy motion pictures The film was one of the first films to link genres together to invent a new high concept genre for filmmakers to build upon Finally along with Steven Spielberg s Jaws it shifted the film industry s focus away from personal filmmaking of the s and towards fast paced big budget blockbusters for younger audiences Some critics have blamed Star Wars and Jaws for ruining Hollywood by shifting its focus from sophisticated films such as The Godfather Taxi Driver and Annie Hall to films about spectacle and juvenile fantasy and for the industry shift from stand alone one and done films towards blockbuster franchises with multiple sequels and prequels One such critic Peter Biskind complained When all was said and done Lucas and Spielberg returned the s audience grown sophisticated on a diet of European and New Hollywood films to the simplicities of the pre s Golden Age of movies They marched backward through the looking glass In an opposing view Tom Shone wrote that through Star Wars and Jaws Lucas and Spielberg didn t betray cinema at all they plugged it back into the grid returning the medium to its roots as a carnival sideshow a magic act one big special effect which was a kind of rebirth Fan works Main article Star Wars fan films The Star Wars saga has inspired many fans to create their own non canon material set in the Star Wars galaxy In recent years this has ranged from writing fan fiction to creating fan films In Lucasfilm sponsored the first annual Official Star Wars Fan Film Awards officially recognizing filmmakers and the genre Because of concerns over potential copyright and trademark issues however the contest was initially open only to parodies mockumentaries and documentaries Fan fiction films set in the Star Wars universe were originally ineligible but in Lucasfilm changed the submission standards to allow in universe fiction entries Lucasfilm has allowed but not endorsed the creation of fan fiction as long as it does not attempt to make a profit Academia As the characters and the storyline of the original trilogy are so well known educators have used the films in the classroom as a learning resource For example a project in Western Australia honed elementary school students storytelling skills by role playing action scenes from the movies and later creating props and audio visual scenery to enhance their performance Others have used the films to encourage second level students to integrate technology in the science classroom by making prototype lightsabers Similarly psychiatrists in New Zealand and the US have advocated their use in the university classroom to explain different types of psychopathology See also Star Wars portal Science fiction portal Architecture of Star Wars Jedi census

researching the inspiration behind Alex Raymond s Flash Gordon comic leading him to the works of author Edgar Rice Burroughs the John Carter of Mars series in particular Played by Jake Lloyd as a kid
