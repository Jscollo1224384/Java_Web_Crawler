popular culture Merchandising Lego See also References External links Concept and creation Frank Oz provided Yoda s voice in each film and used his skills as a puppeteer in the original trilogy and Star Wars Episode I The Phantom Menace For some walking scenes in Episodes V and I dwarf actors Deep Roy and Warwick Davis appeared in costume as Yoda though neither was credited While Frank Oz served as the primary performer he was assisted by a multitude of other puppeteers including Kathryn Mullen Ep V Wendy Froud Ep V David Barclay Ep V VI Mike Quinn Ep VI David Greenaway Ep I VI Don Austen Ep I and Kathy Smee Ep I For the radio dramatizations of The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi Yoda was voiced by John Lithgow while Tom Kane voiced him in the Clone Wars animated series several video games and the series Star Wars The Clone Wars George Lucas had originally conceived of Yoda s full name as being Minch Yoda before shortening it The make up artist Stuart Freeborn based Yoda s face partly on his own and partly on Albert Einstein s In The Phantom Menace he was redesigned to look younger He was computer generated for two distant shots but remained mostly a puppet The puppet was re designed by Nick Dudman from Stuart Freeborn s original design Rendered with computer animation in Star Wars Episode II Attack of the Clones and Star Wars Episode III Revenge of the Sith Yoda appeared in ways not previously possible including his participation in elaborate fight scenes In Revenge of the Sith his face appears in several big close ups demanding highly detailed CGI work His performance was deliberately designed to be consistent with the limitations of the puppet version with some mistakes made such as the occasional ear jiggling citation needed Rob Coleman was responsible for the character s new incarnation to the series Yoda was recreated in CGI for the Blu ray release of The Phantom Menace A clip of the new CG Yoda from The Phantom Menace was first seen in the featurette The Chosen One included in the DVD release of Revenge of the Sith The theatrical D release of The Phantom Menace also features the CG version of Yoda Character overview Jedi Master Yoda is amongst the oldest most stoic and most powerful known Jedi Masters in the Star Wars universe Series creator George Lucas opted to have many details of the character s life history remain unknown Yoda s race and home world have not been named in any official media canonical or otherwise and he is merely said to be of a species unknown by the Star Wars Databank Yoda s characteristic speech patterns have been analyzed and discussed by academic syntacticians who found it somewhat inconsistent but could extrapolate that it has object subject verb word order making it anastrophe The films and Expanded Universe reveal that he had a hand in training almost every Jedi Master in the galaxy including Count Dooku who is identified in Attack of the Clones as Yoda s old Padawan learner Mace Windu Obi Wan Kenobi partially before Qui Gon Jinn takes over as Obi Wan s master citation needed Ki Adi Mundi Kit Fisto and eventually Luke Skywalker During the animated series Star Wars Clone Wars set between Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith he mentions that he trained another one of the leaders on the Jedi Council Master Oppo Rancisis In the Star Wars prequel films he instructs several younglings in the Jedi Temple before they are assigned to a master This was displayed in a scene in Attack of the Clones In The Empire Strikes Back he mentioned that he had been training Jedi for years which means he must have been a Master Jedi for quite some time before that Appearances Feature films Original trilogy The Empire Strikes Back Yoda makes his first film appearance in The Empire Strikes Back Luke Skywalker Mark Hamill arrives on Dagobah to seek his guidance having been instructed to do so by the Force ghost of Obi Wan Kenobi Alec Guinness Yoda does not initially identify himself to Luke and instead tests his patience by presenting himself as a comical and senile backwater individual deliberately provoking both Luke and R D Kenny Baker Luke is shocked when he finally discovers that this small elderly creature is the powerful Jedi Master he was seeking Finding that Luke has the same anger and recklessness which caused his father s downfall Yoda is reluctant to teach him in the ways of the Force and agrees only at Obi Wan s behest Before finishing his training however Luke chooses to leave Dagobah in order to confront Darth Vader and save his friends at Bespin Yoda and Obi Wan warn him that he is not ready to face Vader and is being lured into a trap but Luke leaves anyway promising to return When Obi Wan laments that Luke is their last hope Yoda reminds him that there is another Return of the Jedi Yoda makes a brief appearance in Return of the Jedi set a year after The Empire Strikes Back Yoda now sick and frail informs Luke that he has completed his training but will not be a Jedi until he confronts Darth Vader he also confirms that Vader is Luke s father something Vader had told Luke in the previous film Yoda then peacefully dies at the age of his body disappearing as he becomes one with the Force He leaves Luke with the knowledge that there is another Skywalker his last words Moments later Obi Wan s ghost helps Luke come to the realization that the other of whom Yoda spoke is Princess Leia Carrie Fisher who is his twin sister In the film s final scene after the Empire has been defeated Luke sees Yoda s spirit looking upon him with pride alongside Obi Wan and the redeemed Anakin Skywalker Vader s former Jedi self Prequel trilogy Star Wars Episode I The Phantom Menace Yoda returns as a younger version of himself in the prequel trilogy beginning with The Phantom Menace The film marked the final time Oz would portray the character as a puppet until the release of The Last Jedi However in the Blu ray release of The Phantom Menace the Yoda puppet was replaced by a CGI character to match the later depiction of the character In the film which is set years before The Empire Strikes Back Jedi Master Qui Gon Jinn Liam Neeson brings the young Anakin Skywalker Jake Lloyd to the Jedi Council Qui Gon is convinced that Anakin is the Chosen One of Jedi prophecy who will bring balance to the Force and requests the boy be trained as a Jedi Yoda senses great fear in Anakin especially in regards to his attachment to his mother and foresees grave danger in his training The Council led at the time by Yoda s former padawan Mace Windu Samuel L Jackson rejects Qui Gon s request When Qui Gon is mortally wounded in a duel with Sith Lord Darth Maul played by Ray Park and voiced by Peter Serafinowicz his dying request to his Padawan Obi Wan Kenobi Ewan McGregor is that Anakin be trained as a Jedi Obi Wan determined to fulfill his promise to his master tells Yoda that he will train the boy even without the Council s approval Yoda makes Obi Wan a Jedi Knight and reluctantly gives his blessing to Anakin s training Star Wars Episode II Attack of the Clones Yoda s CGI appearance in Attack of the Clones Yoda makes his first CGI appearance in Attack of the Clones Set a decade after The Phantom Menace Yoda now in direct control of the Order s policy as Master of the High Council in addition to his traditional position as Grandmaster is one of the many Jedi who are concerned about the emergence of the Separatists a group of systems rebelling against the Galactic Republic After the first attempted assassination of Senator Padm Amidala Natalie Portman Chancellor Palpatine Ian McDiarmid suggests that she be put under the protection of Obi Wan who is training Anakin now played by Hayden Christensen At the climax of the film Yoda arrives in time to save Obi Wan and Anakin from the Separatists and defeats his former apprentice Count Dooku Christopher Lee in a lightsaber duel Star Wars Episode III Revenge of the Sith In Revenge of the Sith Yoda leads the Jedi Council in pursuing the mysterious Sith Lord Darth Sidious Palpatine has by now amassed near dictatorial emergency powers and begins interfering in Jedi affairs by appointing Anakin as his personal representative on the Council The Council grants Anakin a Council seat but denies him the rank of Master feeling that doing so would amount to giving Palpatine a vote in the Council Additionally they order him to spy on Palpatine whom Anakin considers a friend and mentor Confused and angered by the perceived snub and the instructions to commit what he believes to be treason Anakin continues to lose faith in the Jedi Order Anakin seeks Yoda s counsel about his prophetic visions that someone close to him will die Yoda unaware that the person Anakin speaks of is Padm or that she is Anakin s wife and pregnant with his child tells him to train himself to let go of everything that he fears to lose Unsatisfied Anakin turns to Palpatine who then reveals himself as Darth Sidious Palpatine manipulates the young Jedi into becoming his Sith apprentice Darth Vader with the promise that the dark side holds the power to save Padm from dying in childbirth Palpatine later transforms the Republic into the tyrannical Galactic Empire proclaiming himself emperor for life and orders the clone troopers to kill their Jedi generals At this time Yoda is on Kashyyyk overseeing the battle between the Separatist forces and a combined command of clone troopers and Wookiees Through the Force Yoda feels the deaths of each of the Jedi as they are assassinated by their own troops After swiftly killing the clone troopers instructed to kill him he escapes with Wookiee leaders Tarfful and Chewbacca Peter Mayhew and returns to Coruscant where he and Obi Wan fight their way into the Jedi Temple to stop a trap for all surviving Jedi Inside they discover that all the Jedi inside younglings included have been slaughtered They then discover a holographic recording revealing Vader as the assassin Yoda decides to face Palpatine sending Obi Wan to kill Vader When Obi Wan protests Yoda tells him that the Anakin he knew no longer exists having been consumed by Darth Vader Subsequently Yoda battles Palpatine in a lightsaber duel that wrecks the Senate Rotunda In the end neither is able to overcome the other and Yoda is forced to retreat He goes into exile on Dagobah so that he may hide from the Empire and wait for another opportunity to destroy the Sith At the end of the film it was revealed that Yoda has been in contact with Qui Gon s spirit learning the secret of immortality from him and passing it on to Obi Wan Yoda is also instrumental in deciding the fate of the Skywalker children after Padm dies in childbirth recommending that Luke and Leia be hidden from Vader and Palpatine in remote locations Other than the ancient Jedi Master only the Organas the Lars family R D and Obi Wan know of their true identities Sequel trilogy Star Wars The Force Awakens In The Force Awakens set years after Return of the Jedi Yoda s voice is heard by the young scavenger Rey Daisy Ridley after she discovers Luke Skywalker s lightsaber Star Wars The Last Jedi In Star Wars The Last Jedi Yoda appears to Luke as a Force spirit as Luke debates whether to burn down the tree storing the only remaining copies of the Sacred Texts of the Jedi As Luke makes his way to the tree Yoda appears behind him and talks to Luke about the inner conflicts going on inside him and reminds him that a Jedi must always be sure of his path When Luke decides against burning down the tree and destroying the texts Yoda summons a lightning bolt down upon the tree setting it ablaze while Luke steps back in horror at the sight of the texts seemingly being lost forever unaware that Rey had taken them earlier as she left the island When confronting Yoda as to why he did it Yoda tells Luke that the true Jedi knowledge is within Jedi themselves and it is their responsibility not books to pass that knowledge on and continue the way of the Jedi As Luke takes in the message he sits with Yoda and shares a quiet moment with his former
