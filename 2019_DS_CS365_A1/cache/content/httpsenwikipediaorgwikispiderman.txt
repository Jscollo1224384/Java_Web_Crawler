spider these include clinging to surfaces shooting spider webs from wrist mounted devices and detecting danger with his spider sense When Spider Man first appeared in the early s teenagers in superhero comic books were usually relegated to the role of sidekick to the protagonist The Spider Man series broke ground by featuring Peter Parker a high school student from Queens behind Spider Man s secret identity and with whose self obsessions with rejection inadequacy and loneliness young readers could relate While Spider Man had all the makings of a sidekick unlike previous teen heroes such as Bucky and Robin Spider Man had no superhero mentor like Captain America and Batman he thus had to learn for himself that with great power there must also come great responsibility a line included in a text box in the final panel of the first Spider Man story but later retroactively attributed to his guardian the late Uncle Ben Marvel has featured Spider Man in several comic book series the first and longest lasting of which is The Amazing Spider Man Over the years the Peter Parker character developed from a shy nerdy New York City high school student to troubled but outgoing college student to married high school teacher to in the late s a single freelance photographer In the s he joins the Avengers Marvel s flagship superhero team Spider Man s nemesis Doctor Octopus also took on

links Publication history Further information List of Spider Man titles Creation and development Richard Wentworth a k a the Spider in the pulp magazine The Spider Stan Lee stated that it was the name of this character that inspired him to create a character that would become Spider Man In with the success of the Fantastic Four Marvel Comics editor and head writer Stan Lee was casting about for a new superhero idea He said the idea for Spider Man arose from a surge in teenage demand for comic books and the desire to create a character with whom teens could identify In his autobiography Lee cites the non superhuman pulp magazine crime fighter the Spider as a great influence and in a multitude of print and video interviews Lee stated he was further inspired by seeing a spider climb up a wall adding in his autobiography that he has told that story so often he has become unsure of whether or not this is true note Although at the time teenage superheroes were usually given names ending with boy Lee says he chose Spider Man because he wanted the character to age as the series progressed and moreover felt the name Spider Boy would have made the character sound inferior to other superheroes He also decided to insert a hyphen in the name as he felt it looked too similar to Superman another superhero with a red and blue costume which starts with an S and ends with man At that time Lee had to get only the consent of Marvel publisher Martin Goodman for the character s approval In a interview Lee described in detail his arguments to overcome Goodman s objections note Goodman eventually agreed to a Spider Man tryout in what Lee in numerous interviews recalled as what would be the final issue of the science fiction and supernatural anthology series Amazing Adult Fantasy which was renamed Amazing Fantasy for that single issue cover dated August on sale June In particular Lee stated that the fact that it had already been decided that Amazing Fantasy would be canceled after issue was the only reason Goodman allowed him to use Spider Man While this was indeed the final issue its editorial page anticipated the comic continuing and that The Spiderman sic will appear every month in Amazing Regardless Lee received Goodman s approval for the name Spider Man and the ordinary teen concept and approached artist Jack Kirby As comics historian Greg Theakston recounts Kirby told Lee about an unpublished character on which he had collaborated with Joe Simon in the s in which an orphaned boy living with an old couple finds a magic ring that granted him superhuman powers Lee and Kirby immediately sat down for a story conference Theakston writes and Lee afterward directed Kirby to flesh out the character and draw some pages Steve Ditko would be the inker note When Kirby showed Lee the first six pages Lee recalled I hated the way he was doing it Not that he did it badly it just wasn t the character I wanted it was too heroic Lee turned to Ditko who developed a visual style Lee found satisfactory Ditko recalled One of the first things I did was to work up a costume A vital visual part of the character I had to know how he looked before I did any breakdowns For example A clinging power so he wouldn t have hard shoes or boots a hidden wrist shooter versus a web gun and holster etc I wasn t sure Stan would like the idea of covering the character s face but I did it because it hid an obviously boyish face It would also add mystery to the character Although the interior artwork was by Ditko alone Lee rejected Ditko s cover art and commissioned Kirby to pencil a cover that Ditko inked As Lee explained in I think I had Jack sketch out a cover for it because I always had a lot of confidence in Jack s covers In an early recollection of the character s creation Ditko described his and Lee s contributions in a mail interview with Gary Martin published in Comic Fan Summer Stan Lee thought the name up I did costume web gimmick on wrist spider signal At the time Ditko shared a Manhattan studio with noted fetish artist Eric Stanton an art school classmate who in a interview with Theakston recalled that although his contribution to Spider Man was almost nil he and Ditko had worked on storyboards together and I added a few ideas But the whole thing was created by Steve on his own I think I added the business about the webs coming out of his hands Amazing Fantasy August first introduced the character It was a gateway to commercial success for the superhero and inspired the launch of The Amazing Spider Man comic book Cover art by penciller Jack Kirby and inker Steve Ditko Kirby disputed Lee s version of the story and claimed Lee had minimal involvement in the character s creation According to Kirby the idea for Spider Man had originated with Kirby and Joe Simon who in the s had developed a character called the Silver Spider for the Crestwood Publications comic Black Magic who was subsequently not used note Simon in his autobiography disputed Kirby s account asserting that Black Magic was not a factor and that he Simon devised the name Spider Man later changed to The Silver Spider while Kirby outlined the character s story and powers Simon later elaborated that his and Kirby s character conception became the basis for Simon s Archie Comics superhero the Fly Artist Steve Ditko stated that Lee liked the name Hawkman from DC Comics and that Spider Man was an outgrowth of that interest Simon concurred that Kirby had shown the original Spider Man version to Lee who liked the idea and assigned Kirby to draw sample pages of the new character but disliked the results in Simon s description Captain America with cobwebs note Writer Mark Evanier notes that Lee s reasoning that Kirby s character was too heroic seems unlikely Kirby still drew the covers for Amazing Fantasy and the first issue of The Amazing Spider Man Evanier also disputes Kirby s given reason that he was too busy to draw Spider Man in addition to his other duties since Kirby was said Evanier always busy Neither Lee s nor Kirby s explanation explains why key story elements like the magic ring were dropped Evanier states that the most plausible explanation for the sudden change was that Goodman or one of his assistants decided that Spider Man as drawn and envisioned by Kirby was too similar to the Fly Author and Ditko scholar Blake Bell writes that it was Ditko who noted the similarities to the Fly Ditko recalled that Stan called Jack about the Fly adding that d ays later Stan told me I would be penciling the story panel breakdowns from Stan s synopsis It was at this point that the nature of the strip changed Out went the magic ring adult Spider Man and whatever legend ideas that Spider Man story would have contained Lee gave Ditko the premise of a teenager bitten by a spider and developing powers a premise Ditko would expand upon to the point he became what Bell describes as the first work for hire artist of his generation to create and control the narrative arc of his series On the issue of the initial creation Ditko states I still don t know whose idea was Spider Man Kirby noted in a interview that it was Ditko who got Spider Man to roll and the thing caught on because of what he did Lee while claiming credit for the initial idea has acknowledged Ditko s role stating If Steve wants to be called co creator I think he deserves it He has further commented that Ditko s costume design was key to the character s success since the costume completely covers Spider Man s body people of all races could visualize themselves inside the costume and thus more easily identify with the character Commercial success A few months after Spider Man s introduction publisher Goodman reviewed the sales figures for that issue and was shocked to find it was one of the nascent Marvel s highest selling comics A solo ongoing series followed beginning with The Amazing Spider Man cover dated March The title eventually became Marvel s top selling series with the character swiftly becoming a cultural icon a Esquire poll of college campuses found that college students ranked Spider Man and fellow Marvel hero the Hulk alongside Bob Dylan and Che Guevara as their favorite revolutionary icons One interviewee selected Spider Man because he was beset by woes money problems and the question of existence In short he is one of us Following Ditko s departure after issue July John Romita Sr replaced him as penciler and would draw the series for the next several years In Romita would also draw the character s extra length stories in the comics magazine The Spectacular Spider Man a proto graphic novel designed to appeal to older readers It only lasted for two issues but it represented the first Spider Man spin off publication aside from the original series summer annuals that began in An early s Spider Man story led to the revision of the Comics Code Previously the Code forbade the depiction of the use of illegal drugs even negatively However in the Nixon administration s Department of Health Education and Welfare asked Stan Lee to publish an anti drug message in one of Marvel s top selling titles Lee chose the top selling The Amazing Spider Man issues May July feature a story arc depicting the negative effects of drug use In the story Peter Parker s friend Harry Osborn becomes addicted to pills When Spider Man fights the Green Goblin Norman Osborn Harry s father Spider Man defeats the Green Goblin by revealing Harry s drug addiction While the story had a clear anti drug message the Comics Code Authority refused to issue its seal of approval Marvel nevertheless published the three issues without the Comics Code Authority s approval or seal The issues sold so well that the industry s self censorship was undercut and the Code was subsequently revised In a second monthly ongoing series starring Spider Man began Marvel Team Up in which Spider Man was paired with other superheroes and villains From that point on there have generally been at least two ongoing Spider Man series at any time In his second solo series Peter Parker the Spectacular Spider Man began running parallel to the main series A third series featuring Spider Man Web of Spider Man launched in to replace Marvel Team Up The launch of a fourth monthly title in the adjectiveless Spider Man with the storyline Torment written and drawn by popular artist Todd McFarlane debuted with several different covers all with the same interior content The various versions combined sold over million copies an industry record at the time Several limited series one shots and loosely related comics have also been published and Spider Man makes frequent cameos and guest appearances in other comic series In The Sensational Spider Man was created to replace Web of Spider Man In writer artist John Byrne revamped the origin of Spider Man in the issue limited series Spider Man Chapter One December October similar to Byrne s adding details and some revisions to Superman s origin in DC Comics The Man of Steel At the same time the original The Amazing Spider Man was ended with issue November and The Amazing Spider Man was restarted with vol January In Marvel reintroduced the original numbering for The Amazing Spider Man and what would have been vol became issue December When primary series The Amazing Spider Man reached issue December Marvel dropped its spin off ongoing series and instead began publishing The Amazing Spider Man three times monthly beginning with all January The three times monthly scheduling of The Amazing Spider Man lasted until November when the comic book was increased from pages to pages each issue and published only twice a month beginning with both November The following year Marvel launched Avenging Spider Man as the first spinoff ongoing series in addition to the still twice monthly The Amazing Spider Man since the previous ones were canceled at the end of The Amazing series temporarily ended with issue in December and was replaced by The Superior Spider Man which had Doctor Octopus serve as the new Spider Man having taken over Peter Parker s body Superior was an enormous commercial success for Marvel and ran for issue before the real Peter Parker returned in a newly relaunched The Amazing Spider Man in April Following the Secret Wars event a number of Spider Man related titles were either relaunched or created as part of the All New All Different Marvel event Among them The Amazing Spider Man was relaunched as well and primarily focuses

Jan Watson returns and is cold toward him That controversial storyline One More Day rolled back much of the fictional continuity at the behest of editor in chief Joe Quesada who said Peter being single is an intrinsic part of the very foundation of the world of Spider Man It caused unusual public friction between Quesada and writer Straczynski who told Joe that I was going to take my name off the last two issues of the story arc but was talked out of doing so At issue with Straczynski s climax to the arc Quesada said was that we didn t receive the story and methodology to the resolution that we were all expecting What made that very problematic is that we had four writers and artists well underway on the sequel arc Brand New Day that were expecting and needed One More Day to end in the way that we had all agreed it would The fact that we had to ask for the story to move back to its original intent understandably made Joe upset and caused some major delays and page increases in the series Also the science that Joe was going to apply to the retcon of the marriage would have made over years of Spider Man books worthless because they never would have had happened I t would have reset way too many things outside of the Spider Man titles We just couldn t go there In this new continuity designed to have very limited repercussions throughout the remainder of the Marvel Universe

while also giving him freedom to come and go as he liked so long as he delivered good results Spider Man assisted the Avengers in defeating Doctor Octopus army of macro octobots He then faced a new Hobgoblin and the Kingpin but days later he lamentably lost Marla in a fight between Alistair Smythe s Spider Slayers Spider Island After helping Anti Venom Eddie Brock to reveal Mr Negative s identity as well as learning that Aunt May was moving to Boston with Jay Spider Man found himself with a new problem the Jackal returned and gave the majority of New Yorkers spider powers The Queen

adjusting to his new status quo especially his position as the CEO of his very own company Peter learned of the existence of Cindy Moon a second person to have been bit by the same radioactive spider which granted Peter his powers Spider Man tracked her down and freed her from a bunker owned by the late Ezekiel Simms where Cindy had spent over a decade in voluntary confinement shortly after getting her powers in order to avoid drawing Morlun s attention While Peter notified Cindy that Morlun was dead he had in fact survived his last encounter against Spider Man Not long after rescuing Cindy who went on to adopt her own superheroic identity as Silk Spider Man was approached by a contingent of spider people from all over the Multiverse that banded together to fight the Inheritors a group of psychic vampires and family of Morlun that had begun to hunt down the spider totems of other realities During a mission to gather more recruits in A D the Spider Army stumbled upon another party of spider people led by Otto Octavius or rather a version of him from the recent past who had been plucked out of time The combined Spider Army were forced to retreat to Earth after their safe zone in Earth had been compromised by the Inheritors namely Morlun his brother Jennix and his father and leader of the Inheritors Solus With the help of Spider Woman who had previously infiltrated the Inheritor s base on Earth the Spider Army learned of a prophecy in which the Inheritors planned to sacrifice three key spiders the Other the Bride and the Scion These individuals were Kaine Parker Cindy Moon and Benjy Parker of Earth respectively With the help of even more recruits from other realities and even a deviant Inheritor named Karn the Spider Army including a version of Gwen Stacy with spider powers known as Spider Gwen launched one final attack on the Inheritors home of Earth The ritual was stopped and the Inheritors were exiled with no means to return home to the radioactive wasteland that had become the world of Earth With the Inheritors neutralized most of the spider totems were sent home Spider Man and a few others stayed on Earth for a little while longer to defeat the time displaced Octavius who had gone rogue after learning that Parker would eventually regain control of his body Octavius was defeated and returned to the time he had come from losing memory of the recent events in the process With no more problems to confront Spider Man and the rest of the spiders were sent back home All New All Different Marvel Unbeknownst to anyone Otto Octavius had created a digital back up of his own mind which ended up inhabiting the metallic body of Parker Industries robotic assistant the Living Brain Over the course of the following months Octavius routinely hacked into the systems of the market share to manipulate its numbers in the favor of Parker Industries As a consequence of this the company managed to expand into a global conglomerate with numerous bases in different countries with the company s trademark invention being a mobile device called the Webware This change in Peter s life impacted his super heroic alter ego as well Spider Man officially became the mascot of Parker Industries under the guise of being Peter s bodyguard Spidey s gone global One of Peter s biggest challenges during his tenure as a billionaire C E O was the emergence of a mysterious biotech company operating out of the Transamerica Pyramid called New U Peter discovered it was a front for the operations of the Jackal who claimed to have found a way to bring people back from the dead using cloning technology In an attempt to persuade Peter to put Parker Industries resources to help his plan the Jackal resurrected numerous of his late friends and foes including Gwen Stacy In a turn of events the Jackal was revealed to be Ben Reilly who had been brought to life by the original Jackal before taking his place The Jackal s plan eventually fell apart following the triggering of cellular decay in the clones created by New U which led to the release of the Carrion Virus worldwide The crisis was adverted when Spider Man had his Webwares transmit an audio frequency in a global scale which halted the cellular degeneration but not before most of the clones died The Jackal being a clone himself was left for dead though he secretly escaped and returned to the mantle of the Scarlet Spider Fresh Start Following Osborn s latest defeat Peter s life was plagued with problems on both sides As Spider Man now Mayor Wilson Fisk decided to be publicly accepting of him while condemning all other vigilantes in order to isolate him from his superhero peers As Peter Parker his academic credentials were revoked after being accused of plagiarizing his doctoral dissertion from Octavius and unable to defend himself without revealing his secret identity resulting in his firing from the Daily Bugle On the other hand Peter became romantically involved again with Mary Jane and was given an opportunity to re apply for his doctoral thesis on the recommendation of Dr Connors For a brief time Peter Parker and Spider Man were split into separate beings due to an accident involving the reverse engineered Isotope Genome Accelerator However the separation split Peter down the middle so both individuals didn t share Peter s sense of responsibility resulting in a reckless and vain Spider Man Peter eventually managed to reverse the process and merge his two halves back together before the side effects could worsen and result in their death More recently Spider Man has been plagued by visions of a mysterious villain named Kindred who has seemingly been working with Mysterio As this happened villains Black Ant and Taskmaster captured animal themed supervillains for Kraven the Hunter as part of a plan to destroy unworthy hunters In the process Dr Connors child Billy was kidnapped alongside Black Cat and were forced to fight for their survival in New York s Central Park which was at that time surrounded by an energy field Meanwhile the Vulture brainwashed a group of fellow supervillains and led an attack against the unworthy hunters Spider Man was tasked with finding Kraven the Hunter whose ultimate goal through the hunt was to anger Spider Man and lead him to killing Kraven ending his curse After Spider Man refused and Dr Connors saved his child Kraven lifted the force field from Central Park allowing Spider Man Connors and Billy and Black Cat to escape while the Avengers rounded up all loose criminals The Hunted arc ended with Kraven donning a Spider Man disguise effectively becoming the Spider and allowing his cloned son to kill him Personality and themes People often say glibly that Marvel succeeded by blending super hero adventure stories with soap opera What Lee and Ditko actually did in The Amazing Spider Man was to make the series an ongoing novelistic chronicle of the lead character s life Most super heroes had problems no more complex or relevant to their readers lives than thwarting this month s bad guys Parker had far more serious concern in his life coming to terms with the death of a loved one falling in love for the first time struggling to make a living and undergoing crises of conscience Comics historian Peter Sanderson Sally Kempton for the Village Voice opined in that Spider Man has a terrible identity problem a marked inferiority complex and a fear of women He is anti social sic castration ridden racked with Oedipal guilt and accident prone a functioning neurotic Agonizing over his choices always attempting to do right he is nonetheless viewed with suspicion by the authorities who seem unsure as to whether he is a helpful vigilante or a clever criminal Notes cultural historian Bradford W Wright Spider Man s plight was to be misunderstood and persecuted by the very public that he swore to protect In the first issue of The Amazing Spider Man J Jonah Jameson publisher of the Daily Bugle launches an editorial campaign against the Spider Man menace The resulting negative publicity exacerbates popular suspicions about the mysterious Spider Man and makes it impossible for him to earn any more money by performing Eventually the bad press leads the authorities to brand him an outlaw Ironically Peter finally lands a job as a photographer for Jameson s Daily Bugle The mid s stories reflected the political tensions of the time as early s Marvel stories had often dealt with the Cold War and Communism As Wright observes From his high school beginnings to his entry into college life Spider Man remained the superhero most relevant to the world of young people Fittingly then his comic book also contained some of the earliest references to the politics of young people In in the wake of actual militant student demonstrations at Columbia University Peter Parker finds himself in the midst of similar unrest at his Empire State University Peter has to reconcile his natural sympathy for the students with his assumed obligation to combat lawlessness as Spider Man As a law upholding liberal he finds himself caught between militant leftism and angry conservatives Powers skills and equipment A bite from a radioactive spider triggers mutations in Peter Parker s body granting him superpowers In the original Lee Ditko stories Spider Man has the ability to cling to walls based on distance dependent interaction between his body and the surfaces known as the Van der Waals force superhuman strength a sixth sense spider sense that alerts him to danger perfect balance and equilibrium as well as superhuman speed and agility The character was originally conceived by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko as intellectually gifted but later writers have depicted his intellect at genius level Academically brilliant Parker has expertise in the fields of applied science chemistry physics biology engineering mathematics and mechanics With his talents he sews his own costume to conceal his identity and he constructs many devices that complement his powers most notably mechanical web shooters to help navigate and trap his enemies along with a spider signal as a flashlight and a warning beacon to criminals Supporting cast Spider Man has had a wide range of connected characters during his inception The Amazing Spider Man

comics book depictions Spider Man is cited to have more than one archenemy and it can be debated or disputed as to which one is worse Doctor Octopus is regarded as one of Spider Man s worst enemies and archenemy He has been cited as the man Peter might have become if he had not been raised with a sense of responsibility He is infamous for being the first villain that victoriously defeated Spider Man during their first encounter and for almost marrying Peter s Aunt May He is the core leader of the Sinister Six and has also referred himself as the Master Planner If This Be My Destiny Later depictions revealed him in Peter Parker s body where he was the titular character for a while Norman Osborn using the Green Goblin alias is as commonly described as Spider Man s archenemy Mostly after he is the first villain to uncover the hero s true identity being responsible for setting up the death of Spider Man s girlfriend in one of the most famous Spider Man stories of all time which helped end the Silver Age of Comic Books and begin the Bronze Age of Comic Books He was thought to be dead after that but writers brought him back in the s and he returned to plague Spider Man once more in

Creation of Spider Man comic book writer editor and historian Paul Kupperberg calls the character s superpowers nothing too original what was original was that outside his secret identity he was a

the world of comics the flawed superhero with everyday problems This idea spawned a comics revolution The insecurity and anxieties in Marvel s early s comic books such as The Amazing Spider Man The

Imagination Brooklyn NY ISBN p unnumbered He gave me reasons why Spider Man would never work Nobody likes spiders it sounds too much like Superman and how could a teenager be a superhero Then I told him I wanted the character to be a very human guy someone who makes mistakes who worries who gets acne has trouble with his girlfriend things like that Goodman replied He s a hero He s not an average man I said No we make him an average man who happens to have super powers that s what will make him good He told me I was crazy Ditko Steve Roy Thomas ed Alter Ego The Comic Book Artist Collection TwoMorrows Publishing ISBN Stan said a new Marvel hero would be introduced in of what became titled Amazing Fantasy He would be called Spider Man Jack would do the penciling and I was to ink the character At this point still Stan said Spider Man would be a teenager with a magic ring which could transform him into an adult hero Spider Man I said it sounded like the Fly which Joe Simon had done for Archie Comics Stan called Jack about it but I don t know what was discussed I never talked to Jack about Spider Man Later at some point I was given the job of drawing Spider Man Jack Kirby in Shop Talk Jack Kirby Will Eisner s Spirit Magazine February Spider Man was discussed between Joe Simon and myself It was the last thing Joe and I had discussed We had a strip called The Silver Spider The Silver Spider was going into a magazine called Black Magic Black Magic folded with Crestwood Simon Kirby s s comics company and we were left with the script I believe I said this could become a thing called Spider Man see a superhero character I had a lot of faith in the superhero character that they could be brought back and I said Spider Man would be a fine character to start with But Joe had already moved on So the idea was already there when I talked to Stan Simon Joe with Jim Simon The Comic Book Makers Crestwood II ISBN There were a few holes in Jack s never dependable memory For instance there was no Black Magic involved at all Jack brought in the Spider Man logo that I had loaned to him before we changed the name to The Silver Spider Kirby laid out the story to Lee about the kid who finds a ring in a spiderweb gets his powers from the ring and goes forth to fight crime armed with The Silver Spider s old web spinning pistol Stan Lee said Perfect just what I want After obtaining permission from publisher Martin Goodman Lee told Kirby to pencil up an origin story Kirby using parts of an old rejected superhero named Night Fighter revamped the old Silver Spider script including revisions suggested by Lee But when Kirby showed Lee the sample pages it was Lee s turn to gripe He had been expecting a skinny young kid who is transformed into a skinny young kid with spider powers Kirby had him turn into Captain America with cobwebs He turned Spider Man over to Steve Ditko who ignored Kirby s pages tossed the character s magic ring web pistol and goggles and completely redesigned Spider Man s costume and equipment In this life he became high school student Peter Parker who gets his spider powers after being bitten by a radioactive spider Lastly the Spider
