Creative Reception Awards References External links Game modes Currently Fortnite is distributed as three different game modes using the same engine and has similar graphics art assets and game mechanics Fortnite Save the World is designed as player versus environment game with four players cooperating towards a common objective on various missions The game is set after a fluke storm appears across Earth causing of the population to disappear and the survivors to be attacked by zombie like husks The players take the role of commanders of home base shelters collecting resources saving survivors and defending equipment that help to either collect data on the storm or to push back the storm From missions players are awarded a number of in game items which include hero characters weapon and trap schematics and survivors all of which can be leveled up through gained experience to improve their attributes Fortnite Battle Royale is a player versus player battle royale game for up to players allowing one to play alone in a duo or in a squad usually consisting of three or four players Weaponless players airdrop from a Battle Bus that crosses the game s map When they land they must scavenge for weapons items resources and even vehicles while trying to stay alive and attack other players eliminating them Over the course of a round the safe area of the map shrinks down in size due to an incoming storm players outside that safe area take damage and can be eliminated if they fail to quickly evacuate This forces remaining players into tighter spaces and encourages player encounters The last player duo or squad remaining is the winner Fortnite Creative is a sandbox game mode where players are given complete freedom to create anything they want on an island such as battle arenas race courses platforming challenges and more Epic Games reviews some of the most popular creations from Creative and rotate these into the Battle Royale map in an area called The Block Featured creations are also shown in the Creative Hub In the first two modes players can use a pickaxe to knock down existing structures on the map to collect basic resources that are wood brick and metal Subsequently in all modes the player can use these materials to build fortifications with such as walls floors and stairs Such fortification pieces can be edited to add things like windows or doors The materials used have different durability properties and can be updated to stronger variants using more materials of the same type Within Save the World this enables players to create defensive fortifications around an objective or trap filled tunnels to lure husks through In Battle Royale this provides the means to quickly traverse the map protect oneself from enemy fire or to delay an advancing foe Players are encouraged to be very creative in designing their fortifications in Creative All game modes are set to be free to play titles though as of Save the World is in early access and requires purchase to play The first two games are monetized through the use of V Bucks in game currency that can be purchased with real world funds but also earned through completing missions and other achievements in Save the World V Bucks in Save the World can be used to buy pinatas shaped like llamas to gain a random selection of items In Battle Royale V Bucks can be used to buy cosmetic items like character models or the like or can also be used to purchase the game s Battle Pass a tiered progression of customization rewards for gaining experience and completing certain objectives during the course of a Battle Royale season Development Fortnite Save the World Main article Fortnite Save the World Development Fortnite began from an internal game jam at Epic Games following the publishing of Gears of War around Though it was not initially one of the developed titles during the jam the concept of merging the construction game genre representing games like Minecraft and Terraria and shooter games arose leading to the foundation of Fortnite Development of Fortnite slowed due to several issues including switching from the Unreal Engine to Unreal Engine a deeper role playing game approach to extend the life of the game and a switch of art style from a dark theme to a more cartoonish style Further Epic was looking to get into the games as a service model and brought in Chinese publisher Tencent to help Tencent took a large stake in Epic as part of this leading to the departure of several executives including Cliff Bleszinski who had been a key part of Fortnite s development Fortnite s approach was changed to be Epic s testbed for games as a service and further slowed the development Ultimately Epic was able to prepare to release Fortnite as a paid early access title in July with plans to release it as free to play sometime in while gaining feedback from players to improve the game With the release of Fortnite Battle Royale the player versus environment mode was distinguished as Save the World Fortnite Battle Royale Main article Fortnite Battle Royale Development Near the same time that Epic released Fortnite into early access PlayerUnknown s Battlegrounds had become a worldwide phenomenon having sold over million copies three months from its March release and drawing strong interest in the battle royale genre Epic recognized that with the Fortnite base game they could also do a battle royale mode and rapidly developed their own version atop Fortnite in about two months By September Epic was ready to release this as a second mode from Save the World in the paid for earlier access but then later decided to release it as a free game Fortnite Battle Royale supported with microtransactions This version quickly gained players with over million players during its first two weeks of release and leading Epic to create separate teams to continue the Fortnite Battle Royale development apart from the Save the World mode outside of common engine elements and art assets This allowed Fortnite Battle Royale to expand to other platforms otherwise not supported by the Save the World mode including iOS and Android mobile devices and the Nintendo Switch Fortnite Creative Main article Fortnite Creative A creative mode launched on December coincident with the start of Season of Fortnite Battle Royale Here each player has access to a private persistent island which they construct buildings and add and manipulate objects as desired Players are able to invite friends to this island and participate in unofficial games such as race tracks or jumping courses Initially only players who bought the Battle Pass could get their own private island but players who didn t purchase it got access to this game mode for free on December Reception The Fortnite Pro Am event at E See also Fortnite Save the World Reception and Fortnite Battle Royale Reception With all modes of Fortnite still considered to be early access journalists have yet to provide comprehensive reviews of any mode The Save the World mode achieved over one million players by August just prior to the release of Battle Royale Fortnite Battle Royale on the other hand became a significant financial success for Epic Games leading them to separate the teams between Save the World and Battle Royale to provide better support for both modes Within two weeks of release over million players had played the mode and by June just after the Nintendo Switch release had reached million players Revenue from Fortnite Battle Royale during the first half of had been estimated in the hundreds of millions of dollars per month with total revenue estimated at billion by analysis firm SuperData Research Fortnite Battle Royale has also become a cultural online phenomenon with several celebrities reporting they play the game and athletes using Fortnite emotes as victory celebrations A notable streaming event in March with streamer Ninja playing Fortnite Battle Royale alongside Drake Travis Scott Kim DotCom and Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver JuJu Smith Schuster broke viewership records for Twitch to date and led to Epic arranging a Fortnite Battle Royale pro am with pairs of streamers and professional players matched with celebrities at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in June Epic Games has developed organized esports competitions around Fortnite Battle Royale such as the inaugural US million Fortnite World Cup tournament that took place in July There has also been growing concern over Fortnite Battle Royale s draw
