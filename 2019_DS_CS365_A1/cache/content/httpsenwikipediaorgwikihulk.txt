resenting of the other Following his accidental exposure to gamma rays during the detonation of an experimental bomb Banner is physically transformed into the Hulk when subjected to emotional stress at or against his will often leading to destructive rampages and conflicts that complicate Banner s civilian life The Hulk s level of strength is normally conveyed as proportionate to his level of anger Commonly portrayed as a raging savage the Hulk has been represented with other personalities based on Banner s fractured psyche from a mindless destructive force to a brilliant warrior or genius

References External links Publication history Further information List of Hulk titles Concept and creation The Hulk first appeared in The Incredible Hulk cover dated May written by writer editor Stan Lee penciled and co plotted by Jack Kirby and inked by Paul Reinman Lee cites influence from Frankenstein and Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde in the Hulk s creation It was patently apparent that the monstrous character the Thing was the most popular character in Marvel s recently created superhero team the Fantastic Four For a long time I d been aware of the fact that people were more likely to favor someone who was less than perfect It s a safe bet that you remember Quasimodo but how easily can you name any of the heroic handsomer more glamorous characters in The Hunchback of Notre Dame And then there s Frankenstein I ve always had a soft spot in my heart for the Frankenstein monster No one could ever convince me that he was the bad guy He never wanted to hurt anyone he merely groped his torturous way through a second life trying to defend himself trying to come to terms with those who sought to destroy him I decided I might as well borrow from Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde as well our protagonist would constantly change from his normal identity to his superhuman alter ego and back again Kirby commenting upon his influences in drawing the character recalled as inspiration the tale of a mother who rescues her child who is trapped beneath a car Lee has also compared Hulk to the Golem of Jewish mythology In The Science of Superheroes Gresh and Weinberg see the Hulk as a reaction to the Cold War and the threat of nuclear attack an interpretation shared by Weinstein in Up Up and Oy Vey This interpretation corresponds with other popularized fictional media created during this time period which took advantage of the prevailing sense among Americans that nuclear power could produce monsters and mutants In the debut Lee chose grey for the Hulk because he wanted a color that did not suggest any particular ethnic group Colorist Stan Goldberg however had problems with the grey coloring resulting in different shades of grey and even green in the issue After seeing the first published issue Lee chose to change the skin color to green Green was used in retellings of the origin with even reprints of the original story being recolored for the next two decades until The Incredible Hulk vol December reintroduced the grey Hulk in flashbacks set close to the origin story An exception is the early trade paperback Origins of Marvel Comics from which explains the difficulties in keeping the grey color consistent in a Stan Lee written prologue and reprints the origin story keeping the grey coloration Since December reprints of the first issue have displayed the original grey coloring with the fictional canon specifying that the Hulk s skin had initially been grey Lee gave the Hulk s alter ego the alliterative name Bruce Banner because he found he had less difficulty remembering alliterative names Despite this in later stories he misremembered the character s name and referred to him as Bob Banner an error which readers quickly picked up on The discrepancy was resolved by giving the character the official full name Robert Bruce Banner Series history The Hulk s original series was canceled with issue March Lee had written each story with

Hulk regains control and promptly leaves upon realizing Betty s true nature With the crisis concluded the Hulk contacted Doctor Doom for help separating him and Banner for good in return for an unspecified favour Doom proceeded to perform brain surgery on the Hulk extracting the uniquely Banner elements from the Hulk s brain and cloning a new body for Banner When Doctor Doom demands to keep Banner for his own purposes the Hulk reneges on the deal and flees with Banner s body leaving his alter ego in the desert where he was created to ensure that Doctor Doom cannot use Banner s intellect When Banner goes insane due to his separation from the Hulk irradiating an entire tropical island trying to recreate his transformation something he cannot do as the cloned body lacks the genetic elements of Banner that allowed him to process the gamma radiation the Hulk is forced to destroy his other side by letting him be disintegrated by a gamma bomb prompting the Hulk to accuse Doom of tampering with Banner s mind only for Doom to observe that what was witnessed was simply Banner without the Hulk to use as a scapegoat for his problems Initially assuming that Banner is dead the Hulk soon realizes that Banner was somehow re combined with him when the gamma bomb disintegrated Banner s body resulting in the Hulk finding himself waking up in various strange locations including helping the Punisher confront a drug cartel run by a mutated dog hunting sasquatches with Kraven the Hunter and being forced to face Wolverine and the Thing in an old SHIELD base Banner eventually

part of the brain to incapacitate him without triggering a transformation Iron Man used the Extremis to cure the Hulk This procedure also increased Banner s mental capacity which gave him the intelligence to tweak the Extremis virus within him and unleash a new persona for the Hulk the super intelligent Doc Green During the Original Sin storyline Bruce Banner confronted by the eye of the murdered Uatu the Watcher Bruce temporarily experienced some of Tony Stark s memories of their first meeting before either of them became the Hulk or Iron Man During this vision Bruce witnessed Tony modifying the gamma bomb to be more effective prompting Bruce to realize that Tony was essentially responsible for him becoming the Hulk in the first place Subsequent research reveals that Tony s tampering had actually refined the bomb s explosive potential so that it would not disintegrate everyone within the blast radius with the result that Tony s actions had actually saved Bruce s life In the AXIS storyline when a mistake made by the Scarlet Witch causes various heroes and villains to experience a moral inversion Bruce Banner attended a meeting between Nick Fury Jr and Maria Hill of S H I E L D and the Avengers who refused to turn over Red Skull Later when he sided with Edwin Jarvis and tried to prevent his teammates from executing the Red Skull the Hulk was thrown aside by Luke Cage The Hulk s sorrow at his friends betrayal awakened a new persona known as the bloodthirsty Kluh described as the Hulk s Hulk being the ruthless part of himself that even the Hulk repressed with this new version easily defeating the Avengers sneering that the Hulk they knew was nothing more than a sad piece of Doc Green s ID Kluh then leaves to wreak havoc with Nova attempting to stop him after witnessing his rampage with the remaining good heroes As with the other inverted Avengers and X Men Kluh was restored to Hulk when Brother Voodoo was summoned back to life by Doctor Doom so that

be depowered He developed a serum made from Adamantium nanobites that absorbed gamma energy He used these to depower Red Leader Red She Hulk Red Hulk Skaar Gamma Corps and A Bomb but decided to spare She Hulk as he concluded that she was the one gamma mutation whose life had been legitimately improved by her mutation At the close of the storyline Doc Green discovered that he was beginning to

The witnesses in the Dogs of Hell told Detective Gloria Mayes of the attacker as she and reporter Jackie McGee have a suspicion that it was Hulk even though Banner is believed to be dead Alternative versions of Hulk Main article Alternative versions of the Hulk A number of alternate universes and alternate timelines in Marvel Comics publications allow writers to introduce variations on the Hulk in which the character s origins behavior and morality differ from the mainstream setting citation needed In some stories someone other than Bruce Banner is the Hulk In some versions the Hulk succumbs to the darker side of his nature in Future Imperfect December a future version of the Hulk has become the Maestro the tyrannical and ruthless ruler of a nuclear war irradiated Earth and in Old Man Logan an insane Hulk rules over a post apocalyptic California and leads a gang of his inbred Hulk children created with his first cousin She Hulk Characterization Statue of the Hulk Like other long lived characters the Hulk s character and cultural interpretations have changed with time adding or modifying character traits The Hulk is typically seen as a hulking man with green skin wearing only a pair of torn purple pants that survive his physical transformation As the character progressed As Bruce Banner the character is approximately ft in m tall and weighs lb kg but when transformed into the Hulk the character can stand between and feet and m tall and weigh up to lb kg Following his debut Banner s transformations were triggered at nightfall turning him into a grey skinned Hulk In Incredible Hulk the Hulk started to appear with green skin and in Avengers Banner realized that his transformations were now triggered by surges of adrenaline in response to feelings of fear pain or anger Incredible Hulk established that the Hulk s separate personality was not due to the mutation affecting his brain but because Banner was suffering from multiple personality disorder with the savage Green Hulk representing Banner s repressed childhood rage and aggression and the Grey Hulk representing Banner s repressed selfish desires and urges Personality Bruce Banner During his decades of publication Banner has been portrayed differently but common themes persist Banner a physicist is sarcastic and seemingly very self assured when he first appears in Incredible Hulk but is also emotionally withdrawn in most fashions Banner designed the gamma bomb which caused his affliction and the ironic twist of his self inflicted fate has been one of the most persistent common themes Arie Kaplan describes the character thus Robert Bruce Banner lives in a constant state of panic always wary that the monster inside him will erupt and therefore he can t form meaningful bonds with anyone As a child Banner s father Brian often got mad and physically abused both Banner and his mother creating the psychological complex of fear anger and the fear of anger and the destruction it can cause that underlies the character Banner has been shown to be emotionally repressed but capable of deep love for Betty Ross and for solving problems posed to him Under the writing of Paul Jenkins Banner was shown to be a capable fugitive applying deductive reasoning and observation to figure out the events transpiring around him On the occasions that Banner has controlled the Hulk s body he has applied principles of physics to problems and challenges and used deductive reasoning It was shown after his ability to turn into the Hulk was taken away by the Red Hulk that Banner has been extremely versatile as well as cunning when dealing with the many situations that followed When he was briefly separated from the Hulk by Doom Banner became criminally insane driven by his desire to regain the power of the Hulk but once the two recombined he came to accept that he was a better person with the Hulk to provide something for him to focus on controlling rather than allowing his intellect to run without restraint against the world Hulk The original Grey Hulk was shown as average in intelligence who roamed aimlessly and became annoyed at puny humans who took him for a dangerous monster Shortly after becoming the Hulk his transformation continued turning him green coinciding with him beginning to display primitive speech and by Incredible Hulk radiation treatments gave Banner s mind complete control of the Hulk s body While Banner relished his indestructibility and power he was quick to anger and more aggressive in his Hulk form and while he became known as a hero alongside the Avengers his increasing paranoia caused him to leave the group believing he would never be trusted Originally the Hulk was shown as simple minded and quick to anger The Hulk generally divorces his identity from Banner s decrying Banner as puny Banner From his earliest stories the Hulk has been concerned with finding sanctuary and quiet and often is shown reacting emotionally to situations quickly Grest and Weinberg call Hulk the dark primordial side of Banner s psyche Even in the earliest appearances Hulk spoke in the third person Hulk retains a modest intelligence thinking and talking in full sentences and Lee even gives the Hulk expository dialogue in issue six allowing readers to learn just what capabilities Hulk has when the Hulk says But these muscles ain t just for show All I gotta do is spring up and just keep goin In the s Hulk was shown as more prone to anger and rage and less talkative Writers played with the nature of his transformations briefly giving Banner control over the change and the ability to maintain control of his Hulk form Artistically and conceptually the character has become progressively more muscular and powerful in the years since his debut Originally Stan Lee wanted the Hulk to be grey but due to ink problems Hulk s color was changed to green This was later changed in story to indicate that the Grey Hulk and the Savage Hulk are separate personalities or entities fighting for control in Bruce s subconscious The Grey Hulk incarnation can do the more unscrupulous things that Robert Bruce Banner could not bring himself to do with many sources comparing the Grey Hulk to the moody teenager that Banner never allowed himself to be While the Grey Hulk still had the madder he gets the stronger he gets part that is similar to the Savage Hulk it is on a much slower rate It is said by Leader that the Grey Hulk is stronger on nights of the New Moon and weaker on nights of the Full Moon Originally the night is when Bruce Banner becomes the Grey Hulk and changes back by dawn In later comics willpower or stress would have Robert Bruce Banner turn into the Grey Hulk During one storyline where he was placed under a spell to prevent him turning back into Bruce Banner and publicly presumed dead when he was teleported away from a gamma bomb explosion that destroyed an entire town the Grey Hulk adopted a specific name as Joe Fixit a security guard for a Las Vegas casino owner with the Grey Hulk often being referred to as Joe after these events volume issue needed The Gravage Hulk is the result of Robert Bruce Banner using the Gamma Projector on himself which merged his Savage Hulk and Grey Hulk personas This form possesses the raw power of the Savage Hulk and the cunning intellect of the Grey Hulk While he doesn t draw on anger to empower him the Gravage Hulk persona draws on dimensional nexus energies to increase his level The Dark Hulk persona is the result of Hulk being possessed by Shanzar This form has black skin and is viciously strong Convinced that unaided the Banner Green Hulk and Grey Hulk identities would eventually destroy each other Doc Samson uses hypnosis to merge the three to create a new single identity combining Banner s intelligence with the Grey Hulk s and Banner s attitudes and the Green Hulk s body This new or Merged Hulk or Professor Hulk considered himself cured and began a new life but the merger was not perfect and the Hulk sometimes still considered Banner a separate person and when overcome with rage the Merged Hulk would transform back into Banner s human body while still thinking himself the Hulk The Merged Hulk is the largest of the three primary Hulk incarnations and has a higher base line While in a calm emotional state the Merged Hulk is stronger than Savage Hulk when he is calm Unlike the Savage Hulk and the Grey Hulk Robert Bruce Banner subconsciously installed a type of safeguard within this incarnation The safeguard is that when the Merged Hulk gets angry he regresses back to Robert Bruce Banner with the mind of the Savage Hulk The Green Scar persona is unleashed on Sakaar and is considered an enraged version of Gravage Hulk In addition he is an expert in armed combat like the use of swords and shields Green Scar is also a capable leader and an expert strategist Kluh is described as the Hulk s Hulk This form has black skin red lines and a mohawk Kluh had incredible power where he bested the inverted Avengers and knocked around Nova and has normal intellect Doc Green is a variation of the Merged Hulk persona that is the result of Extremis fixing Hulk s brain This persona is powerful enough to destroy Tony Stark s mansion with one thunderclap Immortal Hulk is the result of Bruce Banner and Hulk having been through different deaths and rebirths This incarnation is articulate smart cunning and does merciless attacks on those who do harm Unlike the other Hulk incarnations Immortal Hulk is content with waiting inside Bruce If Bruce is injured by sunset the Immortal Hulk will emerge with his transformation being limited to night time Powers and abilities Banner is considered one of the greatest scientific minds on Earth possessing a mind so brilliant it cannot be measured on any known intelligence test Norman Osborn estimates that he is the fourth most intelligent person on Earth Banner holds expertise in biology chemistry engineering medicine physiology and nuclear physics Using this knowledge he creates advanced technology dubbed Bannertech which is on par with technological development from Tony Stark or Doctor Doom Some of these technologies include a force field that can protect him from the attacks of Hulk level entities and a teleporter The Hulk possesses the potential for seemingly limitless physical strength which is influenced by his emotional state particularly his anger This has been reflected in the repeated comment The madder Hulk gets the stronger Hulk gets The cosmically powerful entity known as the Beyonder once analyzed the Hulk s physiology and claimed that the Hulk s potential strength had no finite element inside Hulk s strength has been depicted as sometimes limited by Banner s subconscious influence when Jean Grey psionically shut Banner off Hulk became strong enough to overpower and destroy the physical form of the villain Onslaught Writer Greg Pak described the Worldbreaker Hulk shown during World War Hulk as having a level of physical power where Hulk was stronger than any mortal and most immortals who ever walked the Earth and depicted the character as powerful enough to completely destroy entire planets His strength allows him to leap into lower Earth orbit or across continents and he has displayed superhuman speed Exposure to radiation has also been shown to make the Hulk stronger His durability regeneration and endurance also increase in proportion to his temper Hulk is resistant to injury or damage though the degree to which varies between interpretations but he has withstood the equivalent of solar temperatures nuclear explosions and planet shattering impacts Despite his remarkable resiliency continuous barrages of high caliber gunfire can hinder his movement to some degree while he can be temporarily subdued by intense attacks with chemical weapons such as anesthetic gases although any interruption of such dosages will allow him to quickly recover He has been shown to have both regenerative and adaptive healing abilities including growing tissues to allow him to breathe underwater surviving unprotected in space for extended periods and when injured healing from most wounds within seconds including on one occasion the complete destruction of most of his body mass His future self the Maestro was even eventually able to recover from being blown to powder As an effect he has an extremely prolonged lifespan He also possesses less commonly described powers including abilities allowing him to home in to his place of origin in New Mexico resist psychic control or unwilling transformation grow stronger from radiation or dark magic punch his way between separate temporal or spatial dimensions and to see and interact with astral forms Some of these abilities were in later years explained as being related his ability to home in on the New Mexico bomb site was due to his latent ability to sense astral forms and spirits since the bomb site was also the place where the Maestro s skeleton was and Maestro s spirit was calling out to him in order to absorb his radiation In the first Hulk comic series massive doses of gamma rays would cause the Hulk to transform back to Banner although this ability was written out of the character by the s citation needed Supporting characters Main article List of Hulk supporting

Ross and her father the often adversarial General Thunderbolt Ross Both Banner and Hulk have families created in their respective personas Banner is son to Brian an abusive father who killed Banner s mother while she tried to protect her son from his father s delusional attacks and cousin to Jennifer Walters the She Hulk who serves as his frequent ally Banner had a stillborn child with Betty while the Hulk has two sons with his deceased second wife Caiera Oldstrong Skaar and Hiro Kala and his DNA was used to create a daughter named Lyra with Thundra the warrior woman The Fantastic Four March featured the Hulk s first battle with the Thing Although many early Hulk stories involve Ross trying to capture or destroy the Hulk the main villain is often a radiation based character like the Gargoyle or the Leader along with other foes such as the Toad Men or Asian warlord General Fang Ross daughter Betty loves Banner and criticizes her father for pursuing the Hulk General Ross right hand man Major Glenn Talbot also loves Betty and is torn between pursuing Hulk and trying to gain Betty s love more honorably Rick Jones serves as the Hulk s friend and sidekick in these early tales The Hulk s archenemies are the Abomination and the Leader The Abomination is more monstrous and wreaks havoc for fun and pleasure The Leader is a super genius who has tried plan after plan to take over the world Cultural impact See also Hulk in other media The Hulk character and the concepts behind it have been raised to the level of iconic status by many within and outside the comic book industry In Official U S PlayStation Magazine claimed the character had stood the test of time as a genuine icon of American pop culture In the Hulk was listed as the th greatest comic book character by Wizard magazine Empire magazine named him as the th greatest comic book character and the fifth greatest Marvel character In the Hulk placed No on IGN s list of Top Comic Book Heroes and fourth on their list of The Top Avengers in Analysis The Hulk is often viewed as a reaction to war As well as being a reaction to the Cold War the character has been a cipher for the frustrations the Vietnam War raised and Ang Lee said that the Iraq War influenced his direction In the Michael Nyman edited edition of The Guardian Stefanie Diekmann explored Marvel Comics reaction to the September attacks Diekmann discussed The Hulk s appearance in the tribute comic Heroes claiming that his greater prominence alongside Captain America aided in stressing the connection between anger and justified violence without having to depict anything more than a well known and well respected protagonist In Marvel Five Fabulous Decades of the World s Greatest Comics Les Daniels addresses the Hulk as an embodiment of cultural fears of radiation and nuclear science He quotes Jack Kirby thus As long as we re experimenting with radioactivity there s no telling what may happen or how much our advancements in science may cost us Daniels continues The Hulk became Marvel s most disturbing embodiment of the perils inherent in the atomic age In Comic Book Nation Bradford Wright alludes to Hulk s counterculture status referring to a Esquire magazine poll amongst college students which revealed that student radicals ranked Spider Man and the Hulk alongside the likes of Bob Dylan and Che Guevara as their favorite revolutionary icons Wright goes on to cite examples of his anti authority symbol status Two of these are The Ballad of the Hulk by Jerry Jeff Walker and the Rolling Stone cover for September a full color Herb Trimpe piece commissioned for the magazine The Hulk has been caricatured in such animated television series as The Simpsons Robot Chicken and Family Guy and such comedy TV series as The Young Ones The character is also used as a cultural reference point for someone displaying anger or agitation For example in a Daily Mirror review of an EastEnders episode a character is described as going into Incredible Hulk mode smashing up his flat In September British Prime Minister Boris Johnson likened himself to The Hulk in an interview with the Mail On Sunday as political pressure built on him to request an extension to the date of the UK s withdrawal from the European Union The Hulk especially his alter ego Bruce Banner is also a common reference in rap music The term was represented as an analogue to marijuana in Dr Dre s while more conventional references are made in Ludacris and Jermaine Dupri s popular single Welcome to Atlanta The Ang Lee directed Hulk film saw discussion of the character s appeal to Asian Americans The Taiwanese born Ang Lee commented on the subcurrent of repression that underscored the character of The Hulk and how that mirrored his own experience Growing up my artistic leanings were always repressed there was always pressure to do something useful like being a doctor Jeff Yang writing for the San Francisco Chronicle extended this self identification to Asian American culture arguing that the passive aggressive streak runs deep among Asian Americans especially those who have entered creative careers often against their parents wishes There have been explorations about the real world possibility of Hulk s gamma radiation based origin In The Science of Superheroes Lois Grest and Robert Weinberg examined Hulk s powers explaining the scientific flaws in them Most notably they point out that the level of gamma radiation Banner is exposed to at the initial blast would induce radiation sickness and kill him or if not create significant cancer risks for Banner because hard radiation strips cells of their ability to function They go on to offer up an alternate origin in which a Hulk might be created by biological experimentation with adrenal glands and GFP Charles Q Choi from LiveScience com further explains that unlike the Hulk gamma rays are not green existing as they do beyond the visible spectrum gamma rays have no color at all that we can describe He also explains that gamma rays are so powerful the most powerful form of electromagnetic radiation and times more powerful than visible light that they can even convert energy into matter a possible explanation for the increased mass that Bruce Banner takes on during transformations Just as the Incredible Hulk is the strongest one there is as he says himself so too are gamma ray bursts the most powerful explosions known Other Marvel characters by the same name Prior to the debut of the Hulk in May Marvel had earlier monster characters that used the name Hulk but had no direct relation Debuting in Strange Tales June was a huge robot built by Albert Poole called the Hulk which was actually armor that Poole would wear In modern day reprints the
