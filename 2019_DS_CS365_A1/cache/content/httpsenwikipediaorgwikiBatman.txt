Action Comics announcing the character s debut in the forthcoming Detective Comics In early the success of Superman in Action Comics prompted editors at National Comics Publications the future DC Comics to request more superheroes for its titles In response Bob Kane created the Bat Man Collaborator Bill Finger recalled that Kane had an idea for a character called Batman and he d like me to see the drawings I went over to Kane s and he had drawn a character who looked very much like Superman with kind of reddish tights I believe with boots no gloves no gauntlets with a small domino mask swinging on a rope He had two stiff wings that were sticking out looking like bat wings And under it was a big sign BATMAN The bat wing like cape was suggested by Bob Kane inspired as a child by Leonardo Da Vinci s sketch of an ornithopter flying device Finger suggested giving the character a cowl instead of a simple domino mask a cape instead of wings and gloves he also recommended removing the red sections from the original costume Finger said he devised the name Bruce Wayne for the character s secret identity Bruce Wayne s first name came from Robert Bruce the Scottish patriot Wayne being a playboy was a man of gentry I searched for a name that would suggest colonialism I tried Adams Hancock then I thought of Mad Anthony Wayne He later said his suggestions were influenced by Lee Falk s popular The Phantom a syndicated newspaper comic strip character with which Kane was also familiar Kane and Finger drew upon contemporary s popular culture for inspiration regarding much of the Bat Man s look personality methods and weaponry Details find predecessors in pulp fiction comic strips newspaper headlines and autobiographical details referring to Kane himself As an aristocratic hero with a double identity Batman had predecessors in the Scarlet Pimpernel created by Baroness Emmuska Orczy and Zorro created by Johnston McCulley Like them Batman performed his heroic deeds in secret averted suspicion by playing aloof in public and marked his work with a signature symbol Kane noted the influence of the films The Mark of Zorro and The Bat Whispers in the creation of the character s iconography Finger drawing inspiration from pulp heroes like Doc Savage The Shadow Dick Tracy and Sherlock Holmes made the character a master sleuth In his autobiography Kane detailed Finger s contributions to Batman s creation One day I called Bill and said I have a new character called the Bat Man and I ve made some crude elementary sketches I d like you to look at He came over and I showed him the drawings At the time I only had a small domino mask like the one Robin later wore on Batman s face Bill said Why not make him look more like a bat and put a hood on him and take the eyeballs out and just put slits for eyes to make him look more mysterious At this point the Bat Man wore a red union suit the wings trunks and mask were black I thought that red and black would be a good combination Bill said that the costume was too bright Color it dark grey to make it look more ominous The cape looked like two stiff bat wings attached to his arms As Bill and I talked we realized that these wings would get cumbersome when Bat Man was in action and changed them into a cape scalloped to look like bat wings when he was fighting or swinging down on a rope Also he didn t have any gloves on and we added them so that he wouldn t leave fingerprints Golden age Subsequent creation credit Kane signed away ownership in the character in exchange for among other compensation a mandatory byline on all Batman comics This byline did not originally say Batman created by Bob Kane his name was simply written on the title page of each story The name disappeared from the comic book in the mid s replaced by credits for each story s actual writer and artists In the late s when Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster began receiving a created by credit on the Superman titles along with William Moulton Marston being given the byline for creating Wonder Woman Batman stories began saying Created by Bob Kane in addition to the other credits Finger did not receive the same recognition While he had received credit for other DC work since the s he began in the s to receive limited acknowledgment for his Batman writing in the letters page of Batman February for example editor Julius Schwartz names him as the creator of the Riddler one of Batman s recurring villains However Finger s contract left him only with his writing page rate and no byline Kane wrote Bill was disheartened by the lack of major accomplishments in his career He felt that he had not used his creative potential to its fullest and that success had passed him by At the time of Finger s death in DC had not officially credited Finger as Batman co creator Jerry Robinson who also worked with Finger and Kane on the strip at this time has criticized Kane for failing to share the credit He recalled Finger resenting his position stating in a interview with The Comics Journal Bob made him more insecure because while he slaved working on Batman he wasn t sharing in any of the glory or the money that Bob began to make which is why he was going to leave Kane s employ Kane should have credited Bill as co creator because I know I was there That was one thing I would never forgive Bob for was not to take care of Bill or recognize his vital role in the creation of Batman As with Siegel and Shuster it should have been the same the same co creator credit in the strip writer and artist Although Kane initially rebutted Finger s claims at having created the character writing in a open letter to fans that it seemed to me that Bill Finger has given out the impression that he and not myself created the Batman t sic as well as Robin and all the other leading villains and characters This statement is fraudulent and entirely untrue Kane himself also commented on Finger s lack of credit The trouble with being a ghost writer or artist is that you must remain rather anonymously without credit However if one wants the credit then one has to cease being a ghost or follower and become a leader or innovator In Kane revisited Finger s situation recalling in an interview In those days it was like one artist and he had his name over it the comic strip the policy of DC in the comic books was if you can t write it obtain other writers but their names would never appear on the comic book in the finished version So Bill never asked me for it the byline and I never volunteered I guess my ego at that time And I felt badly really when he Finger died In September DC Entertainment revealed that Finger would be receiving credit for his role in Batman s creation on the superhero film Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice and the second season of Gotham after a deal was worked out between the Finger family and DC Finger received credit as a creator of Batman for the first time in a comic in October with Batman and Robin Eternal and Batman Arkham Knight Genesis The updated acknowledgment for the character appeared as Batman created by Bob Kane with Bill Finger Early years Batman made his debut in Detective Comics May Cover art by Bob Kane The first Batman story The Case of the Chemical Syndicate was published in Detective Comics May Finger said Batman was originally written in the style of the pulps and this influence was evident with Batman showing little remorse over killing or maiming criminals Batman proved a hit character and he received his own solo title in while continuing to star in Detective Comics By that time Detective Comics was the top selling and most influential publisher in the industry Batman and the company s other major hero Superman were the cornerstones of the company s success The two characters were featured side by side as the stars of World s Finest Comics which was originally titled World s Best Comics when it debuted in fall Creators including Jerry Robinson and Dick Sprang also worked on the strips during this period Over the course of the first few Batman strips elements were added to the character and the artistic depiction of Batman evolved Kane noted that within six issues he drew the character s jawline more pronounced and lengthened the ears on the costume About a year later he was almost the full figure my mature Batman Kane said Batman s characteristic utility belt was introduced in Detective Comics July followed by the boomerang like batarang and the first bat themed vehicle the Batplane in Sept The character s origin was revealed in Nov unfolding in a two page story that establishes the brooding persona of Batman a character driven by the death of his parents Written by Finger it depicts a young Bruce Wayne witnessing his parents murder at the hands of a mugger Days later at their grave the child vows that by the spirits of my parents I will avenge their deaths by spending the rest of my life warring on all criminals The early pulp inflected portrayal of Batman started to soften in Detective Comics April with the introduction of Robin Batman s junior counterpart Robin was introduced based on Finger s suggestion because Batman needed a Watson with whom Batman could talk Sales nearly doubled despite Kane s preference for a solo Batman and it sparked a proliferation of kid sidekicks The first issue of the solo spin off series Batman was notable not only for introducing two of his most persistent enemies the Joker and Catwoman but for a pre Robin inventory story originally meant for Detective Comics in which Batman shoots some monstrous giants to death That story prompted editor Whitney Ellsworth to decree that the character could no longer kill or use a gun By the writers and artists behind the Batman comics had established most of the basic elements of the Batman mythos In the years following World War II DC Comics adopted a postwar editorial direction that increasingly de emphasized social commentary in favor of lighthearted juvenile fantasy The impact of this editorial approach was evident in Batman comics of the postwar period removed from the bleak and menacing world of the strips of the early s Batman was instead portrayed as a respectable citizen and paternal figure that inhabited a bright and colorful environment Silver and Bronze Ages s and early s Batman was one of the few superhero characters to be continuously published as interest in the genre waned during the s In the story The Mightiest Team in the World in Superman June Batman teams up with Superman for the first time and the pair discover each other s secret identity Following the success of this story World s Finest Comics was revamped so it featured stories starring both heroes together instead of the separate Batman and Superman features that had been running before The team up of the characters was a financial success in an era when those were few and far between this series of stories ran until the book s cancellation in Batman comics were among those criticized when the comic book industry came under scrutiny with the publication of psychologist Fredric Wertham s book Seduction of the Innocent in Wertham s thesis was that children imitated crimes committed in comic books and that these works corrupted the morals of the youth Wertham criticized Batman comics for their supposed homosexual overtones and argued that Batman and Robin were portrayed as lovers Wertham s criticisms raised a public outcry during the s eventually leading to the establishment of the Comics Code Authority a code that is no longer in use by the comic book industry The tendency towards a sunnier Batman in the postwar years intensified after the introduction of the Comics Code Scholars have suggested that the characters of Batwoman in and the pre Barbara Gordon Bat Girl in were introduced in part to refute the allegation that Batman and Robin were gay and the stories took on a campier lighter feel In the late s Batman stories gradually became more science fiction oriented an attempt at mimicking the success of other DC characters that had dabbled in the genre New characters such as Batwoman Ace the Bat Hound and Bat Mite were introduced Batman s adventures often involved odd transformations or bizarre space aliens In Batman debuted as a member of the Justice League of America in The Brave and the Bold Feb and went on to appear in several Justice League comic series starting later that same year New Look Batman and camp By sales of Batman titles had fallen drastically Bob Kane noted that as a result DC was planning to kill Batman off altogether In response to this editor Julius Schwartz was assigned to the Batman titles He presided over drastic changes beginning with s Detective Comics May which was cover billed as the New Look Schwartz introduced changes designed to make Batman more contemporary and to return him to more detective oriented stories He brought in artist Carmine Infantino to help overhaul the character The Batmobile was redesigned and Batman s costume was modified to incorporate a yellow ellipse behind the bat insignia The space aliens time travel and characters of the s such as Batwoman Ace and Bat Mite were retired Bruce Wayne s butler Alfred was killed off though his death was quickly reversed while a new female relative for the Wayne family Aunt Harriet came to live with Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson The debut of the Batman television series in had a profound influence on the character The success of the series increased sales throughout the comic book industry and Batman reached a circulation of close to copies Elements such as the character of Batgirl and the show s campy nature were introduced into the comics the series also initiated the return of Alfred Although both the comics and TV show were successful for a time the camp approach eventually wore thin and the show was canceled in In the aftermath the Batman comics themselves lost popularity once again As Julius Schwartz noted When the television show was a success I was asked to be campy and of course when the show faded so did the comic books Starting in writer Dennis O Neil and artist Neal Adams made a deliberate effort to distance Batman from the campy portrayal of the s TV series and to return the character to his roots as a grim avenger of the night O Neil said his idea was simply to take it back to where it started I went to the DC library and read some of the early stories I tried to get a sense of what Kane and Finger were after O Neil and Adams first collaborated on the story The Secret of the Waiting Graves in Detective Comics Jan Few stories were true collaborations between O Neil Adams Schwartz and inker Dick Giordano and in actuality these men were mixed and matched with various other creators during the s nevertheless the influence of their work was tremendous Giordano said We went back to a grimmer darker Batman and I think that s why these stories did so well While the work of O Neil and Adams was popular with fans the acclaim did little to improve declining sales the same held true with a similarly acclaimed run by writer Steve Englehart and penciler Marshall Rogers in Detective Comics Aug April which went on to influence the movie Batman and be adapted for Batman The Animated Series which debuted in Regardless circulation continued to drop through the s and s hitting an all time low in Modern age The Dark Knight Returns See also Alternative versions of Batman Cover art for the first issue of The Dark Knight Returns Frank Miller s limited series The Dark Knight Returns February June returned the character to his darker roots both in atmosphere and tone The comic book which tells the story of a year old Batman coming out of retirement in a possible future reinvigorated interest in the character The Dark Knight Returns was a financial success and has since become one of the medium s most noted touchstones The series also sparked a major resurgence in the character s popularity That year Dennis O Neil took over as editor of the Batman titles and set the template for the portrayal of Batman following DC s status quo altering miniseries Crisis on Infinite Earths O Neil operated under the assumption that he was hired to revamp the character and as a result tried to instill a different tone in the books than had gone before One outcome of this new approach was the Year One storyline in Batman Feb May in which Frank Miller and artist David Mazzucchelli redefined the character s origins Writer Alan Moore and artist Brian Bolland continued this dark trend with s page one shot Batman The Killing Joke in which the Joker attempting to drive Commissioner Gordon insane cripples Gordon s daughter Barbara and then kidnaps and tortures the commissioner physically and psychologically The Batman comics garnered major attention in when DC Comics created a number for readers to call to vote on whether Jason Todd the second Robin lived or died Voters decided in favor of Jason s death by a narrow margin of votes see Batman A Death in the Family Knightfall The Knightfall story arc introduced a new villain Bane who critically injures Batman after pushing him to the limits of his endurance Jean Paul Valley known as Azrael is called upon to wear the Batsuit during Bruce Wayne s convalescence Writers Doug Moench Chuck Dixon and Alan Grant worked on the Batman titles during Knightfall and would also contribute to other Batman crossovers throughout the s s Cataclysm storyline served as the precursor to s No Man s Land a year long storyline that ran through all the Batman related titles dealing with the effects of an earthquake ravaged Gotham City At the conclusion of No Man s Land O Neil stepped down as editor and was replaced by Bob Schreck Another writer who rose to prominence on the Batman comic series was Jeph Loeb Along with longtime collaborator Tim Sale they wrote two miniseries The Long Halloween and Dark Victory that pit an early in his career version of Batman against his entire rogues gallery including Two Face whose origin was re envisioned by Loeb while dealing with various mysteries involving serial killers Holiday and the Hangman In Loeb teamed with artist Jim Lee to work on another mystery arc Batman Hush for the main Batman book The issue storyline has Batman and Catwoman teaming up against Batman s entire rogues gallery including an apparently resurrected Jason Todd while seeking to find the identity of the mysterious supervillain Hush While the character of Hush failed to catch on with readers the arc was a sales success for DC The series became on the Diamond Comic Distributors sales chart for the first time since Batman Oct and Todd s appearance laid the groundwork for writer Judd Winick s subsequent run as writer on Batman with another multi issue arc Under the Hood which ran from Batman April April st century All Star Batman and Robin See also All Star DC Comics In DC launched All Star Batman and Robin a stand alone comic series set outside the main DC Universe continuity Written by Frank Miller and drawn by Jim Lee the series was a commercial success for DC Comics although it was widely panned by critics for its writing and strong depictions of violence Starting in Grant Morrison and Paul Dini were the regular writers of Batman and Detective Comics with Morrison reincorporating controversial elements of Batman lore Most notably of these elements were the science fiction themed storylines of the s Batman comics which Morrison revised as hallucinations Batman suffered under the influence of various mind bending gases and extensive sensory deprivation training Morrison s run climaxed with Batman R I P which brought Batman up against the villainous Black Glove organization which sought to drive Batman into madness Batman R I P segued into Final Crisis also written by Morrison which saw the apparent death of Batman at the hands of Darkseid In the miniseries Batman Battle for the Cowl Wayne s former prot g Dick Grayson becomes the new Batman and Wayne s son Damian becomes the new Robin In June Judd Winick returned to writing Batman while Grant Morrison was given his own series titled Batman and Robin In the storyline Batman The Return of Bruce Wayne saw Bruce travel through history eventually returning to the present day Although he reclaimed the mantle of Batman he also allowed Grayson to continue being Batman as well Bruce decided to take his crime fighting cause globally which is the central focus of Batman Incorporated DC Comics would later announce that Grayson would be the main character in Batman Detective Comics and Batman and Robin

Stephanie Brown Cassandra Cain and Clayface led by Batman and Batwoman DC Comics ended the Rebirth branding in December opting to include everything under a larger DC Universe banner and naming The continuity established by Rebirth continues across DC s comic book titles including volume one of Detective Comics and the third volume of Batman Characterization Bruce Wayne DC Comics concept art of Bruce Wayne Batman s secret identity is Bruce Wayne a wealthy American industrialist As a child Bruce witnessed the murder of his parents Dr Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne which ultimately led him to craft the Batman persona and seek justice against criminals He resides on the outskirts of Gotham City in his personal residence Wayne Manor Wayne averts suspicion by acting the part of a superficial playboy idly living off his family s fortune and the profits of Wayne Enterprises his inherited conglomerate He supports philanthropic causes through his nonprofit Wayne Foundation but is more widely known as a celebrity socialite In public he frequently appears in the company of high status women which encourages tabloid gossip Although Bruce Wayne leads an active romantic life his vigilante activities as Batman account for most of his time Various modern stories have portrayed the extravagant playboy image of Bruce Wayne as a facade This is in contrast to the post Crisis Superman whose Clark Kent persona is the true identity while the Superman persona is the facade In Batman Unmasked a television documentary about the psychology of the character behavioral scientist Benjamin Karney notes that Batman s personality is driven by Bruce Wayne s inherent humanity that Batman for all its benefits and for all of the time Bruce Wayne devotes to it is ultimately a tool for Bruce Wayne s efforts to make the world better Bruce Wayne s principles include the desire to prevent future harm and a vow not to kill Bruce Wayne believes that our actions define us we fail for a reason and anything is possible Writers of Batman and Superman stories have often compared and contrasted the two Interpretations vary depending on the writer the story and the timing Grant Morrison notes that both heroes believe in the same kind of things despite the day night contrast their heroic roles display He notes an equally stark contrast in their real identities Bruce Wayne and Clark Kent belong to different social classes Bruce has a butler Clark has a boss T James Musler s book Unleashing the Superhero in Us All explores the extent to which Bruce Wayne s vast personal wealth is important in his life story and the crucial role it plays in his efforts as Batman Will Brooker notes in his book Batman Unmasked that the confirmation of the Batman s identity lies with the young audience he doesn t have to be Bruce Wayne he just needs the suit and gadgets the abilities and most importantly the morality the humanity There s just a sense about him they trust him and they re never wrong Personality I must have a disguise Criminals are a superstitious cowardly lot So my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts I must be a creature of the night black terrible a a a bat Bruce Wayne Detective Comics November Batman s primary character traits can be summarized as wealth physical prowess deductive abilities and obsession The details and tone of Batman comic books have varied over the years due to different creative teams Dennis O Neil noted that character consistency was not a major concern during early editorial regimes Julie Schwartz did a Batman in Batman and Detective and Murray Boltinoff did a Batman in the Brave and the Bold and apart from the costume they bore very little resemblance to each other Julie and Murray did not want to coordinate their efforts nor were they asked to do so Continuity was not important in those days The driving force behind Bruce Wayne s character is his parents murder and their absence Bob Kane and Bill Finger discussed Batman s background and decided that there s nothing more traumatic than having your parents murdered before your eyes Despite his trauma he sets his mind on studying to become a scientist and to train his body into physical perfection to fight crime in Gotham City as Batman an inspired idea from Wayne s insight into the criminal mind Another of Batman s characterizations is that of a vigilante in order to stop evil that started with the death of his parents he must sometimes break the law himself Although manifested differently by being re told by different artists it is nevertheless that the details and the prime components of Batman s origin have never varied at all in the comic books the reiteration of the basic origin events holds together otherwise divergent expressions The origin is the source of the character s traits and attributes which play out in many of the character s adventures He also speaks over different languages Batman is often treated as a vigilante by other characters in his stories Frank Miller views the character as a dionysian figure a force for anarchy that imposes an individual order Dressed as a bat Batman deliberately cultivates a frightening persona in order to aid him in crime fighting a fear that originates from the criminals own guilty conscience Miller is often credited with reintroducing anti heroic traits into Batman s characterization such as his brooding personality willingness to use violence and torture and increasingly alienated behavior Batman shortly a year after his debut and the introduction of Robin was changed in after DC editor Whitney Ellsworth felt the character would be tainted by his lethal methods and DC established their own ethical code subsequently he was retconned as having a stringent moral code Miller s Batman was closer to the original pre Robin version who was willing to kill criminals if necessary Others Main article Alternate versions of Batman On several occasions former Robin Dick Grayson has served as Batman most notably in while Wayne was believed dead and served as a second Batman even after Wayne returned in As part of DC s continuity relaunch Grayson returned to being Nightwing following the Flashpoint crossover event In an interview with IGN Morrison detailed that having Dick Grayson as Batman and Damian Wayne as Robin represented a reverse of the normal dynamic between Batman and Robin with a more light hearted and spontaneous Batman and a scowling badass Robin Morrison explained his intentions for the new characterization of Batman Dick Grayson is kind of this consummate superhero The guy has been Batman s partner since he was a kid he s led the Teen Titans and he s trained with everybody in the DC Universe So he s a very different kind of Batman He s a lot easier He s a lot looser and more relaxed Over the years there have been numerous others to assume the name of Batman or to officially take over for Bruce during his leaves of absence Jean Paul Valley also known as Azrael assumed the cowl after the events of the Knightfall saga James Gordon donned a mech suit after the events of Batman Endgame and served as Batman in and Additionally members of the group Batman Incorporated Bruce Wayne s experiment at franchising his brand of vigilantism have at times stood in as the official Batman in cities around the world Various others have also taken up the role of Batman in stories set in alternative universes and possible futures including among them various former proteges of Bruce Wayne Supporting characters Main article

Art by Alex Ross Main article List of Batman Family adversaries Batman faces a variety of foes ranging from common criminals to outlandish supervillains Many of them mirror aspects of the Batman s character and development often having tragic origin stories that lead them to a life of crime These foes are commonly referred to as Batman s rogues gallery Batman s most implacable foe is the Joker a homicidal maniac with a clown like appearance The Joker is considered by critics to be his perfect adversary since he is the antithesis of Batman in personality and appearance the Joker has a maniacal demeanor with a colorful appearance while Batman has a serious and resolute demeanor with a dark appearance As a personification of the irrational the Joker represents everything Batman opposes Other long time recurring foes that are part of Batman s rogues gallery include Catwoman a cat burglar antiheroine who is an occasional ally and romantic interest the Penguin Ra s al Ghul Two Face the Riddler the Scarecrow Mr Freeze Poison Ivy Harley Quinn Bane Clayface and Killer Croc among others Many of Batman s adversaries are often psychiatric patients at Arkham Asylum Allies Alfred

Alfred raised Bruce after his parents death and knows him on a very personal level He is sometimes portrayed as a sidekick to Batman and the only other resident of Wayne Manor aside from Bruce The

a group of characters closely allied with Batman generally masked vigilantes who either have been trained by Batman or operate in Gotham City with his tacit approval They include Barbara Gordon Commissioner Gordon s daughter who has fought crime under the vigilante identity of Batgirl and during a period in which she was confined to a wheelchair due to a gunshot wound inflicted by the Joker

at times a member of superhero teams such as the Justice League of America and the Outsiders Batman has often been paired in adventures with his Justice League teammate Superman notably as the co stars of World s Finest and Superman Batman series In pre Crisis continuity the two are depicted as close friends however in current continuity they are still close friends but an uneasy relationship with an emphasis on their differing views on crime fighting and justice In Superman Batman Dec Superman observes Sometimes I admit I think of Bruce as a man in a costume Then with some gadget from his utility belt he reminds me that he has an extraordinarily inventive mind And how lucky I am to be able to call on him Robin Main article Robin comics Batman and Robin Art by Jack Burnley Robin Batman s vigilante partner has been a widely recognized supporting character for many years Bill Finger stated that he wanted to include Robin because Batman didn t have anyone to talk to and it got a little

established in the early s Multiverse where the golden age stories took place Damian Wayne is the biological son of Bruce Wayne and Talia al Ghul and thus the grandson of Ra s al Ghul Terry McGinnis is the biological son of Bruce Wayne in the DC animated universe and has taken over the role as Batman when Bruce has become too elderly to do it Romantic interests Writers have varied in the approach over the years to the playboy aspect of Bruce Wayne s persona Some writers show his playboy reputation as a manufactured illusion to support his mission as Batman while others have depicted Bruce

detective skills and athletic prowess Batman s inexhaustible wealth gives him access to advanced technologies and as a proficient scientist he is able to use and modify these technologies to his advantage In the stories Batman is regarded as one of the world s greatest detectives if not the world s greatest crime solver Batman has been repeatedly described as having a genius level intellect being one of the greatest martial artists in the DC Universe and having peak human physical conditioning As a polymath his knowledge and expertise in countless disciplines is nearly unparalleled by any other character in the DC Universe He has traveled the world acquiring the skills needed to aid him in his endeavors as Batman In the Superman Doomed story arc Superman considers Batman to be one

physical pain and resist most forms of telepathy and mind control He is a master of disguise multilingual and an expert in espionage often gathering information under the identity of a notorious gangster named Matches Malone Batman is highly skilled in stealth movement and escapology which allows him to appear and disappear at will and to break free of nearly inescapable deathtraps with little to no harm Batman is an expert in interrogation techniques and his intimidating and frightening appearance alone is often all that is needed in getting information from suspects Despite having the potential to harm his enemies Batman s most defining characteristic is his strong commitment to justice and his reluctance to take a life This unyielding moral rectitude has earned him the respect of several heroes in the DC Universe most notably that of Superman and Wonder Woman Among physical and other crime fighting related training he is also proficient at other types of skills Some of these include being a licensed pilot in order to operate the Batplane as well as being able to operate other types of machinery In some publications he underwent some magician training Batman is also frequently described as a peak human unreliable source and it has been revealed that he has mostly unintentionally bathed in Lazarus Pits in the past which may or may not attribute some of his more meta human feats Technology Batman utilizes a vast arsenal of specialized high tech vehicles and gadgets in his war against crime the designs of which usually share a bat motif Batman historian Les Daniels credits Gardner Fox with creating the concept of Batman s arsenal with the introduction of the utility belt in Detective Comics July and the first bat themed weapons the batarang and the Batgyro in Detective Comics and Sept Oct Personal armor Main article Batsuit Batman s body armored costume incorporates the imagery of a bat in order to frighten criminals The details of the Batman costume change repeatedly through various decades stories media and artists interpretations but the most distinctive elements remain consistent a scallop hem cape a cowl covering most of the face a pair of bat like ears a stylized bat emblem on the chest and the ever present utility belt Finger and Kane originally conceptualized Batman as having a black cape and cowl and grey suit but conventions in coloring called for black to be highlighted with blue Hence the costume s colors have appeared in the comics as dark blue and grey as well as black and grey In the Tim Burton s Batman and Batman Returns films Batman has been depicted as completely black with a bat in the middle surrounded by a yellow background Christopher Nolan s The Dark Knight Trilogy depicted Batman wearing high tech gear painted completely black with a black bat in the middle Ben Affleck s Batman in the DC Extended Universe films wears a suit grey in color with a black cowl cape and bat symbol Batman s batsuit aids in his combat against enemies having the properties of both Kevlar and Nomex It protects him from gunfire and other significant impacts His gloves typically feature three scallops that protrude from long gauntlet like cuffs although in his earliest appearances he wore short plain gloves without the scallops The overall look of the character particularly the length of the cowl s ears and of the cape varies greatly depending on the artist Dennis O Neil said We now say that Batman has two hundred suits hanging in the Batcave so they don t have to look the same Everybody loves to draw Batman and everybody wants to put their own spin on it Batmobile Main article Batmobile The television Batmobile built by George Barris from a Lincoln Futura concept car Batman s primary vehicle is the Batmobile which is usually depicted as an imposing black car often with tailfins that suggest a bat s wings Batman also has an aircraft called the Batplane later called the Batwing along with various other means of transportation In proper practice the bat prefix as in Batmobile or batarang is rarely used by Batman himself when referring to his equipment particularly after some portrayals primarily the s Batman live action television show and the Super Friends animated series stretched the practice to campy proportions For example the s television show depicted a Batboat Bat Sub and Batcycle among other bat themed vehicles The s television series Batman has an arsenal that includes such bat names as the bat computer bat scanner bat radar bat cuffs bat pontoons bat drinking water dispenser bat camera with polarized bat filter bat shark repellent bat spray and bat rope The storyline A Death in the Family suggests that given Batman s grim nature he is unlikely to have adopted the bat prefix on his own In The Dark Knight Returns Batman tells Carrie Kelley that the original Robin came up with the name Batmobile when he was young since that is what a kid would call Batman s vehicle The Batmobile was redesigned in when DC Comics relaunched its entire line of comic books with the batmobile being given heavier armor and new aesthetics Utility belt Main article Batman s utility belt Batman keeps most of his field equipment in his utility belt Over the years it has shown to contain an assortment of crime fighting tools weapons and investigative and technological instruments Different versions of the belt have these items stored in compartments often as pouches or hard cylinders attached evenly around it Batman is often depicted as carrying a projectile which shoots a retractable grappling hook attached to a cable This allows him to attach to distant objects be propelled into the air and thus swing from the rooftops of Gotham City An exception to the range of Batman s equipment are guns which he refuses to use on principle since a gun was used in his parents murder Bat Signal Main article Bat Signal When Batman is needed the Gotham City police activate a searchlight with a bat shaped insignia over the lens called the Bat Signal which shines into the night sky creating a bat symbol on a passing cloud which can be seen from any point in Gotham The origin of the signal varies depending on the continuity and medium In various incarnations most notably the s Batman TV series Commissioner Gordon also has a dedicated phone line dubbed the Bat Phone connected to a bright red telephone in the TV series which sits on a wooden base and has a transparent top The line connects directly to Batman s residence Wayne Manor specifically both to a similar phone sitting on the desk in Bruce Wayne s study and the extension phone in the Batcave Batcave Main article Batcave The Batcave is Batman s secret headquarters consisting of a series of subterranean caves beneath his mansion Wayne Manor As his command center the Batcave serves multiple purposes supercomputer surveillance redundant power generators forensics lab medical infirmary private study training dojo fabrication workshop arsenal hangar and garage It houses the vehicles and equipment Batman uses in his campaign to fight crime It is also a trophy room and storage facility for Batman s unique memorabilia collected over the years from various cases he has worked on In both the comic Batman Shadow of the Bat and the film Batman Begins the cave is said to have been part of the Underground Railroad Fictional character biography Batman s history has undergone many retroactive continuity revisions both minor and major Elements of the character s history have varied greatly Scholars William Uricchio and Roberta E Pearson noted in the early s Unlike some fictional characters the Batman has no primary urtext set in a specific period but has rather existed in a plethora of equally valid texts constantly appearing over more than five decades th century Origin Main article Origin of Batman Thomas and Martha Wayne are shot by Joe Chill in Detective Comics Nov Art by Bob Kane The central fixed event in the Batman stories is the character s origin story As a young boy Bruce Wayne was horrified and traumatized when he watched his parents the physician Dr Thomas Wayne and his wife Martha murdered with a gun by a mugger named Joe Chill Batman refuses to utilize any sort of gun on the principle that a gun was used to murder his parents This event drove him to train his body to its peak condition and fight crime in Gotham City as Batman Pearson and Uricchio also noted beyond the origin story and such events as the introduction of Robin Until recently the fixed and accruing and hence canonized events have been few in number a situation altered by an increased effort by later Batman editors such as Dennis O Neil to ensure consistency and continuity between stories Golden age See also Batman Earth Two In Batman s first appearance in Detective Comics he is already operating as a crime fighter Batman s origin is first presented in Detective Comics Nov and is later expanded upon in Batman As these comics state Bruce Wayne is born to Dr Thomas Wayne and his wife Martha two very wealthy and charitable Gotham City socialites Bruce is brought up in Wayne Manor and leads a happy and privileged existence until the age of eight when his parents are killed by a small time criminal named Joe Chill while on their way home from a movie theater That night Bruce Wayne swears an oath to spend his life fighting crime He engages in intense intellectual and physical training however he realizes that these skills alone would not be enough Criminals are a superstitious cowardly lot Wayne remarks so my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts I must be a creature of the night black terrible As if responding to his desires a bat suddenly flies through the window inspiring Bruce to craft the Batman persona In early strips Batman s career as a vigilante earns him the ire of the police During this period Bruce Wayne has a fianc e named Julie Madison In Detective Comics Wayne takes in an orphaned circus acrobat Dick Grayson who becomes his vigilante partner Robin Batman also becomes a founding member of the Justice Society of America although he like Superman is an honorary member and thus only participates occasionally Batman s relationship with the law thaws quickly and he is made an honorary member of Gotham City s police department During this time Alfred Pennyworth arrives at Wayne Manor and after deducing the Dynamic Duo s secret identities joins their service as their butler Silver age The Silver Age of Comic Books in DC Comics is sometimes held to have begun in when the publisher introduced Barry Allen as a new updated version of The Flash Batman is not significantly changed by the late s for the continuity which would be later referred to as Earth One The lighter tone Batman had taken in the period between the golden and silver ages led to the stories of the late s and early s that often feature many science fiction elements and Batman is not significantly updated in the manner of other characters until Detective Comics May in which Batman reverts to his detective roots with most science fiction elements jettisoned from the series After the introduction of DC Comics multiverse in the s DC established that stories from the golden age star the Earth Two Batman a character from a parallel world This version of Batman partners with and marries the reformed Earth Two Catwoman Selina Kyle The two have a daughter Helena Wayne who becomes the Huntress She assumes the position as Gotham s protector along with Dick Grayson the Earth Two Robin once Bruce Wayne retires to become police commissioner Wayne holds the position of police commissioner until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman Batman titles however often ignored that a distinction had been made between the pre revamp and post revamp Batmen since unlike The Flash or Green Lantern Batman comics had been published without interruption through the s and would occasionally make reference to stories from the golden age Nevertheless details of Batman s history were altered or expanded upon through the decades Additions include meetings with a future Superman during his youth his upbringing by his uncle Philip Wayne introduced in Batman Feb after his parents death and appearances of his father and himself as prototypical versions of Batman and Robin respectively In then editor Paul Levitz commissioned the Untold Legend of the Batman limited series to thoroughly chronicle Batman s origin and history Batman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the silver age most notably Superman whom he began regularly working alongside in a series of team ups in World s Finest Comics starting in and continuing through the series cancellation in Batman and Superman are usually depicted as close friends As a founding member of the Justice League of America Batman appears in its first story in s Brave and the Bold In the s and s Brave and the Bold became a Batman title in which Batman teams up with a different DC Universe superhero each month Bronze Age In Dick Grayson attends college as part of DC Comics effort to revise the Batman comics Additionally Batman also moves from his mansion Wayne Manor into a penthouse apartment atop the Wayne Foundation building in downtown Gotham City in order to be closer to Gotham City s crime Batman spends the s and early s mainly working solo with occasional team ups with Robin and or Batgirl Batman s adventures also become somewhat darker and more grim during this period depicting increasingly violent crimes including the first appearance since the early golden age of the Joker as a homicidal psychopath and the arrival of Ra s al Ghul a centuries old terrorist who knows Batman s secret identity In the s Dick Grayson becomes Nightwing In the final issue of Brave and the Bold in Batman quits the Justice League and forms a new group called the Outsiders He serves as the team s leader until Batman and the Outsiders and the comic subsequently changed its title Modern age After the issue limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths DC Comics retconned the histories of some major characters in an attempt at updating them for contemporary audiences Frank Miller retold Batman s origin in the storyline Year One from Batman which emphasizes a grittier tone in the character Though the Earth Two Batman is erased from history many stories of Batman s silver age Earth One career along with an amount of golden age ones remain canonical in the post Crisis universe with his origins remaining the same in essence despite alteration For example Gotham s police are mostly corrupt setting up further need for Batman s existence The guardian Phillip Wayne is removed leaving young Bruce to be raised by Alfred Pennyworth Additionally Batman is no longer a founding member of the Justice League of America although he becomes leader for a short time of a new incarnation of the team launched in To help fill in the revised backstory for Batman following Crisis DC launched a new Batman title called Legends of the Dark Knight in and has published various miniseries and one shot stories since then that largely take place during the Year One period Subsequently Batman begins exhibiting an excessive reckless approach to his crime fighting a result of the pain of losing Jason Todd Batman works solo until the decade s close when Tim Drake becomes the new Robin Many of the major Batman storylines since the s have been inter title crossovers that run for a number of issues In DC published Knightfall During the storyline s first phase the new villain Bane paralyzes Batman leading Wayne to ask Azrael to take on the role After the end of Knightfall the storylines split in two directions following both the Azrael Batman s adventures and Bruce Wayne s quest to become Batman once more The story arcs realign in KnightsEnd as Azrael becomes increasingly violent and is defeated by a healed Bruce Wayne Wayne hands the Batman mantle to Dick Grayson then Nightwing for an interim period while Wayne trains for a

the Infinite Crisis miniseries which again restructures DC continuity Batman and a team of superheroes destroy Brother Eye and the OMACs though at the very end Batman reaches his apparent breaking point when Alexander Luthor Jr seriously wounds Nightwing Picking up a gun Batman nearly shoots Luthor in order to avenge his former sidekick until Wonder Woman convinces him to not pull the trigger

interpretations Further information Homosexuality in the Batman franchise Gay interpretations of the character have been part of the academic study of Batman since psychologist Fredric Wertham asserted in Seduction of the Innocent in that Batman stories are psychologically homosexual The Batman type of story may stimulate children to homosexual fantasies of the nature of which they may be unconscious Andy Medhurst wrote in his essay Batman Deviance and Camp that Batman is interesting to gay audiences because he was one of the first fictional characters to be attacked on the grounds of his presumed homosexuality Professor of film and cultural studies Will Brooker argues the validity of a queer reading of Batman and that gay readers would naturally find themselves drawn to the lifestyle depicted within whether the character of Bruce Wayne himself were explicitly gay or not He also identifies a homophobic element to the vigor with which mainstream fandom rejects the possibility of a gay reading of the character In painter Mark Chamberlain displayed a number of watercolors depicting both Batman and Robin in suggestive and sexually explicit poses prompting DC to threaten legal action Creators associated with the character have expressed their own opinions Writer Alan Grant has stated The Batman I wrote for years isn t gay everybody s Batman all the way back to Bob Kane none of them wrote him as a gay character Only Joel Schumacher might have had an opposing view Frank Miller views the character as sublimating his sexual urges into crimefighting so much so that he s borderline pathological concluding He d be much healthier if he were gay Grant Morrison said that Gayness is built into Batman Obviously as a fictional character he s intended to be heterosexual but the basis of the whole concept is utterly gay Psychological interpretations This section needs expansion You can help by adding to it April Batman has been the subject of psychological study for some time and there have been a number of interpretations into the character s psyche In Batman and Psychology A Dark and Stormy Knight Travis Langley argues that the concept of archetypes as described by psychologists Carl Jung and Joseph Campbell is present in the Batman mythos such that the character represents the shadow archetype This archetype according to Langley represents a person s own dark side it is not necessarily an evil one but rather one that is hidden from the outside and concealed from both the world and oneself Langley argues that Bruce Wayne confronts his own darkness early in life he chooses to use it to instill fear in wrongdoers with his bright and dark sides working together to fight evil Langley uses the Jungian perspective to assert that Batman appeals to our own need to face our shadow selves Dr Travis Langley also taught a class called Batman a title he was adamant about I could have called it something like the Psychology of Nocturnal Vigilantism but no I called it Batman Langley says References a b c DC Entertainment To Give Classic Batman Writer Credit in Gotham and Batman v Superman Exclusive Hollywood Reporter
