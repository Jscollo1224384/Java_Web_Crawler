George Lucas Vader s creator Name Series creator George Lucas initially wrote the series main villain as separate from Luke Starkiller s father Annikin sic Various combinations of names for the character were built upon the phrase Dark Water Then Lucas added lots of last names Vaders and Wilsons and Smiths and he just came up with the combination of Darth and Vader After the release of The Empire Strikes Back Lucas said the name Vader was based upon the German Dutch language homophone vater or vader meaning father making the name representative of a Dark Father However there is no evidence that Lucas conceived of Vader as Luke s father before Other words which may have inspired the name are death and invader As no other character with the title Darth was introduced until the release of The Phantom Menace b some viewers interpreted it as the character s first name in part because Obi Wan Kenobi addresses him as Darth in the original film The moniker is bestowed upon Anakin in Revenge of the Sith upon his turn to the dark side of the Force Director Ken Annakin s films Swiss Family Robinson and Battle of the Bulge influenced the original trilogy leading some to believe that Anakin was named after him Lucas s publicist denied this following Annakin s death in Anakin and Luke s original surname Starkiller remained in the script until a few months into filming Star Wars when it was dropped due to what Lucas called unpleasant connotations with Charles Manson and replaced with Skywalker Concept and writing In the first draft of The Star Wars tall grim general Darth Vader was already close in line with his final depiction and the protagonist Annikin Starkiller had a role similar to that of his son Luke s as the year old son of a respected warrior Originally Lucas conceived of the Sith as a group that served the Emperor in the same way that the Schutzstaffel served Adolf Hitler In developing the backstory for The Empire Strikes Back Lucas condensed this into one character in the form of Darth Vader After the success of the original Star Wars Lucas hired science fiction author Leigh Brackett to write the sequel with him They held story conferences and by late November Lucas had produced a handwritten treatment In the first draft that Brackett would write from this Luke s father appears as a ghost to instruct Luke Lucas was disappointed with the script but Brackett died of cancer before he could discuss it with her With no writer available Lucas wrote the next draft himself In this draft dated April he made use of a new plot twist Vader claiming to be Luke s father According to Lucas he found this draft enjoyable to write as opposed to the year long struggles writing the first film The new plot element of Luke s parentage had drastic effects on the series Author Michael Kaminski claims and argues in his book that it is unlikely that the plot point had ever seriously been considered or even conceived of before and that the first film was clearly operating under an alternate storyline where Vader was a separate character from Luke s father After writing the second and third drafts in which the plot point was introduced Lucas reviewed the new backstory he had created Anakin had been Obi Wan Kenobi s brilliant student and had a child named Luke but was swayed to the dark side by Palpatine Anakin battled Obi Wan on the site of a volcano and was badly wounded but was then reborn as Vader Meanwhile Obi Wan hid Luke on Tatooine while the Galactic Republic became the tyrannical Galactic Empire and Vader systematically hunted down and killed the Jedi This change in character would provide a springboard to the tragedy of Darth Vader storyline that underlies the prequel trilogy After deciding to create the prequel trilogy Lucas indicated that the story arc would be a tragic one depicting Anakin s fall to the dark side He also saw that the prequels could form the beginning of one long story that started with Anakin s childhood and ended with his death This was the final step towards turning the film series into a saga For the first prequel Episode I The Phantom Menace Lucas made Anakin nine years old c to make the character s separation from his mother poignant Movie trailers focused on Anakin and a one sheet poster showing him casting Vader s shadow informed otherwise unknowing audiences of the character s eventual fate The movie ultimately achieved a primary goal of introducing audiences to Anakin Author Michael Kaminski in The Secret History of Star Wars offers evidence that issues in Anakin s fall to the dark side prompted Lucas to make massive story changes first revising the opening sequence of the third prequel Revenge of the Sith to have Palpatine kidnapped and his apprentice Count Dooku killed by Anakin in cold blood as the first act in the latter s turn towards the dark side After principal photography was complete in Lucas made even more massive changes in Anakin s character re writing his entire turn to the dark side Anakin s fall from grace would now be motivated by a desire to save his wife Padm Amidala rather than the previous version in which that reason was one of several including that he genuinely believed that the Jedi were plotting to take over the Republic This fundamental re write was accomplished both through editing the principal footage and new and revised scenes filmed during pick ups in During production of the Clone Wars TV series Ahsoka Tano was developed to illustrate how Anakin develops from the brash undisciplined Padawan apprentice in Attack of the Clones to the more reserved Jedi Knight in Revenge of the Sith Clone Wars supervising director and Rebels co creator Dave Filoni said that giving Anakin responsibility for a Padawan was meant to place the character in a role that forced him to become more cautious and responsible It would also give him insight into his relationship with Obi Wan and depict how their relationship matured Ahsoka and Anakin s relationship was seen as an essential story arc spanning both the animated film and Clone Wars television series Filoni began thinking about the final confrontation between Ahsoka and Vader ever since he created the former different iterations had different endings including one in which Vader kills Ahsoka just as she slashes open his helmet to reveal Vader s scarred face Ahsoka s presence in Rebels was necessary to allow Darth Vader to encounter the show s lead characters without the latter being destroyed Ahsoka can stand toe to toe with Vader Design Ralph McQuarrie incorporated Samurai armor into his conceptual designs for Vader s costume in The original design of Darth Vader s costume did not originally include a helmet The idea that Vader should wear a breathing apparatus was first proposed by concept artist Ralph McQuarrie during preproduction discussions for Star Wars with George Lucas in McQuarrie stated that Lucas s artistic direction was to portray a malevolent figure in a cape with Samurai armor For Darth Vader George just said he would like to have a very tall dark fluttering figure that had a spooky feeling like it came in on the wind McQuarrie noted that the script indicated that Vader would travel between spaceships and needed to survive in the vacuum of space and he proposed that Vader should wear some sort of space suit Lucas agreed and McQuarrie combined a full face breathing mask with a Samurai helmet thus creating one of the most iconic designs of space fantasy cinema McQuarrie s production painting of Darth Vader engaged in a lightsaber duel with Deak Starkiller a character prototype for Luke Skywalker depicts Vader wearing black armor a flowing cape and an elongated skull like mask and helmet Its similarity to the final design of Vader s costume demonstrates that McQuarrie s earliest conception of Vader was so successful that very little needed to be changed for production Darth Vader designers Ralph McQuarrie Brian Muir Working from McQuarrie s designs the costume designer John Mollo devised a costume that could be worn by an actor on screen using a combination of clerical robes a motorcycle suit a German military helmet and a gas mask The prop sculptor Brian Muir created the helmet and armour used in the film The sound of the respirator function of Vader s mask was created by Ben Burtt using modified recordings of scuba breathing apparatus used by divers The sound effect is trademarked in the U S Patent and Trademark Office under Trademark and is officially described in the documentation as The sound of rhythmic mechanical human breathing created by breathing through a scuba tank regulator Commentators have often pointed to the influence of Akira Kurosawa s films such as The Hidden Fortress on George Lucas and Vader s Samurai inspired costume design is held up as a significant example of the Japanese influences on Star Wars Portrayals David Prowse physically portrayed Vader in the original film trilogy Darth Vader was portrayed by bodybuilder David Prowse in the original film trilogy and by stunt performer Bob Anderson during the character s intense lightsaber fight scenes Lucas originally intended for Orson Welles to voice Vader after dismissing using Prowse s own voice due to his English West Country accent leading to the rest of the cast nicknaming him Darth Farmer After deciding that Welles s voice would be too recognizable he cast the lesser known James Earl Jones instead Jones initially felt his contributions to the films were too small to warrant recognition and his role was uncredited at his request until the release of Return of the Jedi When Jones was specifically asked if he had supplied Vader s voice for Revenge of the Sith either newly or from a previous recording Jones answered You d have to ask Lucas about that I don t know Hayden Christensen and Gene Bryant alternately portray Vader in Revenge of the Sith During the production of Revenge of the Sith Christensen asked Lucas if a special Vader suit could be constructed to fit his own body rather than have a different actor don one of the original sets of Vader armor worn by Prowse Brock Peters provided the voice of Darth Vader in the NPR USC radio series Both Spencer Wilding and Daniel Naprous portrayed Vader in Rogue One with Jones reprising his role as the character s voice Vader s character has also been portrayed in several video games in games such as Rebel Assault II The Hidden Empire and Dark Forces visual effects artist C Andrew Nelson appears in short sequences in the Vader costume voiced by Scott Lawrence Matt Sloan who appeared in the YouTube parody Chad Vader provided the voice of Darth Vader in The Force Unleashed As a result of his video game appearances Nelson was cast to appear as Vader in brief sequences inserted into the Special Edition of The Empire Strikes Back in which Vader is seen boarding his shuttle During production of Return of the Jedi the casting crew sought an experienced actor for the role of Anakin Skywalker since his death was unquestionably the emotional climax of the film and Sebastian Shaw was selected for the role d When Shaw arrived at the set for filming he ran into his friend Ian McDiarmid the actor playing the Emperor When McDiarmid asked him what he was doing there Shaw responded I don t know dear boy I think it s something to do with science fiction His presence during the filming was kept secret from all but the minimum cast and crew and Shaw was contractually obliged not to discuss any film secrets with anyone even his family The unmasking scene directed by Richard Marquand was filmed in one day and required only a few takes with no alteration from the original dialogue Lucas personally directed Shaw for his appearance in the final scene of the film in which he is a Force Ghost of Anakin Shaw s image in this scene was replaced with that of Christensen in the DVD release This last attempt to tie the prequel and original trilogies together proved to be possibly the most controversial change in the Star Wars re releases Shaw received more fan mail and autograph requests from Return of the Jedi than he had for any role in the rest of his career He later reflected that he very much enjoyed his experience filming Return of the Jedi and expressed particular surprise that an action figure was made of him from the film James Earl Jones voiced Darth Vader in the original trilogy Revenge of the Sith and Rogue One When The Phantom Menace was being produced hundreds of actors were tested for the role of young Anakin before the producers settled on Jake Lloyd who Lucas considered met his requirements of a good actor enthusiastic and very energetic Producer Rick McCallum said that Lloyd was smart mischievous and loves anything mechanical just like Anakin During production of Attack of the Clones casting director Robin Gurland reviewed about other candidates for the role of the young Anakin before Lucas eventually selected Hayden Christensen for the role When Revenge of the Sith was being produced Christensen and Ewan McGregor began rehearsing their climactic lightsaber duel long before Lucas would shoot it They trained extensively with stunt coordinator Nick Gillard to memorize and perform their duel together As in the previous prequel film McGregor and Christensen performed their own lightsaber fighting scenes without the use of stunt doubles Anakin has also been voiced by Mat Lucas for the micro series Clone Wars and by Matt Lanter in the CGI animated film The Clone Wars the television series of the same name and for Anakin s small roles in the animated series Rebels and Forces of Destiny James Earl Jones reprised the voice role for Vader s appearances in Rebels Both Lanter and Jones contributed their voices for the second season finale of Rebels at times with identical dialogue spoken by both actors blended together in different ways Characteristics In Attack of the Clones Anakin Skywalker feels smothered by Obi Wan Kenobi and is incapable of controlling his own life By Revenge of the Sith however his father son friction with his master has matured into a more equal brotherly relationship Once he becomes Darth Vader each evil act he commits shatters any hope or connection towards his previous life which makes it harder for him to return to the light but he ultimately escapes the dark side and redeems himself by sacrificing his life to save his son Luke Skywalker and kill the Emperor in Return of the Jedi Eric Bui a psychiatrist at University of Toulouse Hospital argued at the American Psychiatric Association convention that Anakin Skywalker meets six of the nine diagnostic criteria for borderline personality disorder BPD one more than necessary for a diagnosis He and a colleague Rachel Rodgers published their findings in a letter to the editor of the journal Psychiatry Research Bui says he found Anakin Skywalker a useful example to explain BPD to medical students In particular Bui points to Anakin s abandonment issues and uncertainty over his identity Anakin s mass murders of the Tusken Raiders in Attack of the Clones and the young Jedi in Revenge of the Sith count as two dissociative episodes fulfilling another criterion Bui hoped his paper would help raise awareness of the disorder especially among teens
