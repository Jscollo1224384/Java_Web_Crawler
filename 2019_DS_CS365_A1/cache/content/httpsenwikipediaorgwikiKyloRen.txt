promotional material Novels Reception Family tree References Sources Further reading External links Concept and creation edit Abrams requested that Ren s mask be designed to be memorable to a child As late as March the film s main antagonist was only known to the production team as Jedi Killer and had gone through numerous unapproved design attempts The same month Glyn Dillon s design for the character s costume was finally approved According to Abrams the design was meant to be a nod to the Vader mask and concept designer Doug Chiang says that the character takes on the persona of Vader to haunt Luke According to The Force Awakens costume designer Michael Kaplan I don t know if it was the kind of spaghetti type lines on it or what but the next time J J came by that was what we presented to him and he loved it Also the silver in those lines kind of reflects and changes color with the action You know if he s standing in front of fire you see that so it almost brings you into the mask Driver s casting in the film in an unnamed role was first announced on April Kylo Ren was first seen but still not named in the second The Force Awakens teaser trailer released by Lucasfilm on November wielding a jagged red lightsaber with a crossguard The name Kylo Ren was revealed by Entertainment Weekly in a Lucasfilm designed Topps style trading card mock up in December A May Vanity Fair photo shoot by Annie Leibovitz confirmed that Driver would be portraying Kylo According to other cast members Driver is a method actor which meant that he sometimes stayed in character on set as Ren and left his mask on between scenes Driver explained that his goal was to forget you re in Star Wars and treat it like any other job that s filled with moments and problems because from the perspective of the characters living within the film s universe Darth Vader is real Character edit Abrams told Empire in August Kylo Ren is not a Sith He works under Supreme Leader Snoke who is a powerful figure on the Dark Side of the Force Abrams had previously told Entertainment Weekly that the character came to the name Kylo Ren when he joined a group called the Knights of Ren Robbie Collin of The Telegraph described Ren as a hot headed radicalised Dark Side jihadi whose red lightsaber splutters and crackles as violently as his temper Abrams noted The lightsaber is something that he built himself and is as dangerous and as fierce and as ragged as the character The Telegraph also explains that Ren s wild and erratic temper and angsty instability make him dangerous Melissa Leon of The Daily Beast describes Ren s use of the Force as formidable citing his ability to stop a blaster shot mid air immobilize victims and probe their minds against their will Kasdan told Entertainment Weekly in August I ve written four Star Wars movies now and there s never been a character quite like the one that Adam plays I think you re going to see something that s brand new to the saga noting that the character is full of emotion Abrams explained I think that what makes Ren so unique is that he isn t as fully formed as when we meet a character such as Darth Vader He is not your prototypical mustache twirling bad guy He is a little bit more complex than that Driver said in December that despite the visual similarities to Darth Vader Ren is unlike any villain the franchise has seen He explained I feel there s a recklessness about him that s maybe not normally associated with the Dark Side You normally think of order and structure and full commitment and no hesitation he s just a little bit more unpolished It s in his costume in his lightsaber how you kind of get the sense that it could just not work at any moment that it could just blow up That s kind of like a big metaphor for him Appearances edit Model of Kylo s cross bladed lightsaber on display at Star Wars Launch Bay at Disney s Hollywood Studios Feature films edit The Force Awakens edit Main article Star Wars The Force Awakens Kylo Ren first appears in The Force Awakens as a commander in the First Order a tyrannical regime that has risen from the remains of the Galactic Empire After arriving at Jakku to retrieve a map containing the coordinates where Luke Skywalker is to be found Ren kills an old priest known as Lor San Tekka and captures Resistance pilot Poe Dameron who has also been sent to recover the map by General Leia Organa Ren soon learns that the pilot had entrusted his astromech droid BB with the map Poe flees with the help of rogue stormtrooper Finn who later finds BB and the scavenger Rey Finn Rey and BB escape Jakku in the Millennium Falcon and are soon intercepted by the ship s former owner Han Solo and his co pilot Chewbacca It is revealed that Ren is the son of Han and Leia originally named Ben and was once one of Luke s Jedi pupils He was corrupted to the dark side of the Force by the First Order s Supreme Leader Snoke He then helped to destroy his uncle Luke s new Jedi Academy However Ren still feels the pull of the light side of the Force and seeks the strength to overcome it from his grandfather Darth Vader whose burnt helmet is in Ren s possession Arriving at Maz Kanata s castle on Takodana Ren captures Rey who he senses has seen the map While interrogating her he realizes that she is strong with the Force though unaware of it Rey finds herself able to resist his powers and experience Ren s emotions and confronts him over his fear that he will never be as powerful as his grandfather She later uses the Jedi mind trick to compel her stormtrooper guard to let her escape Han arrives at the First Order s superweapon Starkiller Base as part of the Resistance s plan to destroy it After Han plants explosives to destroy the base he confronts Ren calling him by his real name Ben and implores him to abandon the dark side warning him that Snoke will kill him once he accomplishes his goal to seize control of the galaxy Ren tells Han he feels conflicted and asks his father for help which Han promises to give Ren then ignites his lightsaber impaling and killing Han An enraged Chewbacca fires at Ren wounding him As Finn and Rey flee the damaged base Ren follows and confronts them Finn fights Ren with Luke s recovered lightsaber but Ren overpowers and severely wounds him Rey then takes up the lightsaber and using the Force begins to overcome Ren striking him on the face with the lightsaber Before the duel is finished they are separated by a seismic fissure created by the collapsing base Rey and the others escape as Snoke orders General Hux to evacuate the base and bring Ren to him to complete his training The Last Jedi edit Main article Star Wars The Last Jedi Ren s inner conflict continues into The Last Jedi particularly through his conversations with Rey with whom he connects through the Force Rey learns from Luke why Ben Solo turned to the dark side Luke had seen a vision of the destruction Ben would cause and was briefly tempted to kill him when Ben awoke to see Luke with his lightsaber drawn he turned on his uncle and destroyed the Jedi Temple Rey believes that there is still good in Ren and resolves to bring him back to the light side Meanwhile Ren is reproached by Snoke for his failure to defeat Rey and Ren tries to prove himself by leading an attack on a lead Resistance starship He hesitates to destroy it after sensing his mother s presence but his wing man destroy the ship s bridge almost killing Leia Upon Rey s arrival Ren captures her and brings her to Snoke who tortures her for Luke s location before ordering Ren to kill her Instead of complying Ren uses the Force to ignite Luke s lightsaber at Snoke s side and cut him in half and subsequently slays Snoke s royal guard with Rey s assistance After the guards are slain Ren reveals to Rey his goal to create a new order in the galaxy separate from the legacies created by Snoke and Luke and beseeches Rey to join him He tells her that parents abandoned her and that he is the only one who truly cares about her Rey refuses to join him realizing that Ren will not turn back to the light side the two briefly struggle over Luke s lightsaber with the Force resulting in the weapon breaking in half and knocking both warriors unconscious After Rey escapes Ren frames her for Snoke s assassination Force chokes General Hux into acknowledging him as the new Supreme Leader of the First Order and orders his forces to attack the Resistance base on Crait During the attack Luke appears and is heavily fired upon and then personally attacked by Ren Luke remains standing revealing that he is only present as a Force projection serving as a distraction to allow the Resistance to escape from the First Order After Luke vanishes the First Order storms the base but the Resistance has already evacuated Ren shares a final look with Rey through the Force before Rey slams the door to the Millennium Falcon and escapes with the Resistance The Rise of Skywalker edit Main article Star Wars The Rise of Skywalker Kylo Ren will appear in The Rise of Skywalker with Adam Driver reprising his role The Knights of Ren will also

series Lego Star Wars The Resistance Rises and as a playable character in Lego Star Wars The Force Awakens In January Driver reprised the role for a Star Wars Undercover Boss sketch on Saturday Night Live with Kylo Ren disguising himself as a radar technician named Matt to determine what the Starkiller Base employees really think of him Kylo appears in Star Wars Battlefront II voiced by Matthew Wood and Roger Craig Smith masked and unmasked respectively In the game Kylo interrogates Del Meeko about Lor San Tekka s location who possess the map to Luke Skywalker using his Force abilities When

Matthew Wood who also portrayed General Grievous in the prequels and Star Wars The Clone Wars He is also one of the numerous voices heard in the fourth and final season of Star Wars Rebels in the episode A World Between Worlds with Driver reprising his role Novels edit Kylo Ren is a point of view character in the novelization of The Force Awakens by Alan Dean Foster In the Chuck Wendig novel Star Wars Aftermath Empire s End Ben Solo b is stated as having been born on the planet Chandrila on the same day as a peace treaty is signed between the remnants of the Empire and the New Galactic Republic about a year after Return of the Jedi or years before The Force Awakens Kylo Ren is also mentioned in the novel Star Wars Phasma which takes place before The Force Awakens Reception edit Adam Driver received positive reviews for his performance as Kylo Ren Driver won a Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal In January Kylo was voted seventh greatest movie villain of all time by the readers of Empire Many reviewers complimented Ren s conflicted nature and depth as well as his costume design and noted there were many places the character could be taken in future installments Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian praised the character and the actor alike saying He is gorgeously cruel spiteful and capricious and unlike the Vader of old he is given to petulant temper tantrums with his lightsaber drawn Terri Schwartz of IGN also called Driver s performance spectacular noting that his performance adds great depth to a character who could have come off as one dimensional and the implications of his arc leave a viewer with plenty to think about after they leave the theater Collin wrote To describe Kylo Ren as this film s Vader would be accurate in a sense But it would also be to undersell the deep ingenuity with which this astonishing character has been crafted by Abrams Kasdan and Arndt and also the wells of emotional tumult Driver invests in him Comparing the character to the one note Vader of the film Melissa Leon calls Ren a living battleground between darkness and light making him a far more resonant and familiar portrayal of that struggle than we ve ever seen in Star Wars which makes him a far more interesting villain Abrams told Entertainment Weekly it was a great joy to work with Adam Driver on this role because he threw himself into it in a deep and remarkable way Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter noted Ren is given a pronounced inferiority complex a clever bad guy twist that could be taken to interesting places both in the writing and performance Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote The bald faced attempt to clone Vader one of the greatest badasses in film history is clankingly obvious but Driver masked and unmasked gives him hypnotic and haunting contours Kyle Buchanan of Vulture com was underwhelmed by the reveal of Driver under the mask Leon however argued But that face that of a normal vulnerable young man is the most subversively terrifying thing about J J Abrams reimagining of A New Hope Rather than pure evil Ren is something far more familiar He is human Just like the real life young men with minds clouded by fear hate and anger who commit unspeakable acts in our world every day all the visual cues that leave the character open to criticisms of not being evil enough are all signs of Ren s struggle between the Dark Side and the Light Some viewers noted that Ren s character arc shares similarities with that of the Star Wars Expanded Universe character Jacen Solo the son of Han Solo and Princess Leia who threatens the galaxy as a fallen Jedi Additionally critics have noted a resemblance between Ren s character design and that of Revan the protagonist of Knights of the Old Republic
