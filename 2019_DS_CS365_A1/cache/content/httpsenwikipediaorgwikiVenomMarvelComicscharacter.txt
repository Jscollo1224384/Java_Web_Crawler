Reception See also References External links Conception and creation The original idea of a new costume for Spider Man that would later become the character Venom was conceived by a Marvel Comics reader from Norridge Illinois named Randy Schueller In Jim Shooter Marvel s editor in chief at the time sent Schueller a letter acknowledging Marvel s interest in the idea which they ended up purchasing from him for Shooter came up with the idea of switching Spider Man to a black and white costume possibly influenced by the intended costume design for the new Spider Woman artist Mike Zeck designed it Writer artist John Byrne says on his website that he conceived a costume of self healing biological material when he was the artist on Iron Fist to explain how that character s costume was constantly being torn and then apparently repaired by the next issue Byrne says explaining that he ended up not using the idea on that title but that Roger Stern later asked him if he could use the idea for Spider Man s alien costume Stern in turn plotted the issue in which the costume first appeared but then left the title It was writer Tom DeFalco and artist Ron Frenz who established that the costume was a sentient alien being that was vulnerable to high sonic energy during their run on The Amazing Spider Man that preceded Michelinie s The Symbiote was first introduced as Spider man s new black costume in The Amazing Spider Man May as part of a story called Homecoming The story takes place after Spider Man s return from the events of the miniseries Secret Wars where he first obtains the black costume The full first appearance of Venom is in The Amazing Spider Man May after the Symbiote bonds with Eddie Brock Hosts Spider Man Peter Parker Main article Spider Man The Venom Symbiote bonds to Spider Man in Secret Wars Art by Mike Zeck The story of how Spider Man gets his new black costume is recounted in Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars December in which writer Jim Shooter and artist Mike Zeck depicted the heroes and villains of the Marvel Universe transported to another planet called Battleworld by a being called the Beyonder After Spider Man s costume is ruined from battles with the villains he is directed by Thor and the Hulk to a room at the heroes base where they inform him a machine can read his thoughts and instantly fabricate any type of clothing Choosing a machine he believes to be the correct one Spider Man causes a black sphere to appear before him which spreads over his body dissolving the tattered old costume and covering his body to form a new black and white costume To Spider Man s surprise the costume can mimic street clothes and provides a seemingly inexhaustible and stronger supply of webbing During their run on The Amazing Spider Man writer Tom DeFalco and artist Ron Frenz established that the costume was a sentient alien Symbiote that was vulnerable to both fire and high sonic energy It was in that storyline that the costume would envelop Peter Parker while he slept and go out at night to fight crime leaving Parker inexplicably exhausted in the morning Parker had the costume examined by Reed Richards who discovered that it was alive and when Parker realized it was trying to permanently bond to Parker s body he rejected it and it was subsequently contained by the Fantastic Four The Symbiote escaped and bonded again to Parker who used sound waves from a cathedral s church bell to repel it But the symbiote had grown an emotional attachment to Peter so he willingly left Peter s unconscious body and moved him to safety before disappearing In Go Down Swinging when Norman Osborn got bonded to the Carnage symbiote Spider Man rebonds to the symbiote in an attempt to stop Osborn now calling himself Red Goblin while forgiving both Eddie and Venom for the past conflicts He with the symbiote got a new costume design and they were overpowering Osborn until Norman mortally injured Flash Thompson This caused Spider Man and the symbiote to get angry eventually losing control until Flash calmed them down with his dying breath In the final battle Spider Man tells the symbiote to leave him and that he himself is going to be all right while Norman also detaches himself from Carnage Eddie Brock Main article Eddie Brock David Michelinie would later write the backstory of Eddie Brock as the alien s new host that would become the villain Venom using the events of Peter David s Sin Eater storyline in The Spectacular Spider Man as a basis for Brock s origin Venom s existence was first indicated in Web of Spider Man September when he shoved Peter Parker in front of a subway train without Parker s spider sense warning him though only Brock s hand was seen on panel The next indication of Venom s existence was in Web of Spider Man March when Parker climbed out of a high story window to change into Spider Man but found a black arm coming through the window and grabbing him again without being warned by his spider sense After appearing in shadow in The Amazing Spider Man March Venom made his cameo appearance on the last page of The Amazing Spider Man April when he terrorized Parker s wife Mary Jane Watson and made his full appearance in The Amazing Spider Man May Spider Man would confront him in the following issue when Brock reveals that he was a Daily Globe reporter who worked on the Sin Eater case and that his career was ruined when it was discovered that the man Brock announced as the Sin Eater was a compulsive confessor Forced to eke out a living writing lurid stories for venomous tabloids Brock blamed Spider Man for his predicament He took up bodybuilding to reduce stress It failed to do so and Brock sank into a suicidal depression Seeking solace at the church where Spider Man repelled the Symbiote the Symbiote sensing Brock s hatred for Spider Man bonded with the disgraced reporter Brock took on the name Venom in reference to the sensationalistic material he was forced to traffic in following his fall from grace Over the years as the Symbiote gained more intelligence and moved to additional human hosts the name began to apply to the Symbiote as well as its hosts As Venom Brock fights Spider Man many times winning on several occasions Venom repeatedly tries to kill Peter Parker Spider Man both when the latter was in and out of costume Thus Parker is forced to abandon his black costume which the Symbiote had been mimicking after Venom confronts Parker s wife Mary Jane Venom escapes from the supervillain prison The Vault to torment Spider Man and his family

people from harm even if it means working side by side with the hated Spider Man This is especially true when Venom combats the entity he believes to be his spawn Carnage When Spider Man helps Venom save Brock s ex wife Anne Weying the two form a temporary truce though this falls apart after Weying s suicide The Symbiote is temporarily stolen by U S Senator Steward Ward who hopes to better understand his own alien infection by researching the Symbiote before it returns to Brock Now however it dominates its host Brock rather than vice versa Eventually Eddie Brock and the Symbiote go

Sinister Twelve As the Avengers dealt with the rest of the Twelve Spider Man swiftly defeated Gargan even with these additional powers which Spider Man suggests is attributed to the fact that Mac Gargan does not hate Spider Man as much as Eddie Brock did Mac Gargan as the fourth host and the second Venom Gargan later became a member of a sub group of the Thunderbolts which was drafted by the Avengers to hunt down the members of the fugitive New Avengers It was then revealed that he had been outfitted with electrical implants by the government to keep the Symbiote in check When in the Venom persona Gargan retained very little of his original personality and was controlled almost completely by the Symbiote which drove him to cannibalism When the Symbiote was dormant in his body he expressed nausea and fear of the organism During a fight with Anti Venom Eddie Brock he and his Symbiote were separated and the Venom Symbiote was nearly destroyed Blobs of it still existed in his bloodstream however so Osborn injected Gargan with a vaccine for Anti Venom s healing powers which restored the Symbiote by causing the remaining pieces of it to expand rapidly Gargan dons a Scorpion battle armor over the Symbiote while it heals causing him to become what Spider Man calls Ven orpion although when the Symbiote is fully restored it shatters the armor volume issue needed After
