helping the Rebels Palpatine sees this as an opportunity to seek out other remaining Jedi Palpatine then orders Vader to dispatch an Inquisitor to hunt down Ahsoka Palpatine returns physically in season four voiced again by Ian McDiarmid In the episodes Wolves and a Door and A World Between Worlds he appears as a hologram overseeing the excavation of the Lothal Jedi Temple which contains a portal to a separate dimension of the Force outside of space and time which Palpatine considers a conduit between the living and the dead that could give him unrivaled power of the Force itself if he can access it Shortly after protagonist Ezra Bridger reaches through time and space to rescue Ahsoka from Vader Palpatine sets up a portal that shows Kanan Jarrus final moments While Ezra wants to reach through the portal and rescue Kanan Ahsoka convinces him not to Palpatine then reveals himself through the portal and shoots Ezra with Force lightning However Ahsoka and Ezra manage to evade him and go their separate ways thus denying Palpatine full power Palpatine later returns in the series finale Family Reunion and Farewell In the episode Ezra having surrendered himself to Grand Admiral Thrawn to protect Lothal is taken by him to a room containing a reconstructed section of the ruined Jedi Temple and a hologram of Palpatine as he appears in the prequel films Palpatine having

enters it Ezra is initially mesmerized by Palpatine s promise and goes to enter the door but finally resists and destroys the reconstructed Jedi Temple and the illusion Palpatine s hologram emerges from the rubble flickering to show his true self and commands his Royal Guards to kill Ezra though Ezra manages to defeat them and escape According to series creator Dave Filoni the events of Rogue

appearance of Palpatine in Star Wars literature was in Alan Dean Foster s writing as George Lucas novelization of the script of A New Hope published as Star Wars From the Adventures of Luke Skywalker Star Wars Lords of the Sith was one of the first canon spin off novels to be released In it Vader and Palpatine find themselves hunted by revolutionaries on the Twi lek home planet Ryloth In Thrawn the titular character warns Palpatine of threats lurking in the Unknown Regions Chuck Wendig s Aftermath book trilogy reveals that prior to his death Palpatine enacted a plan for the remnants of the Empire to retreat to the Unknown Regions where they formed into the First Order The dark side was thought to be concentrated in this region where one Sith cultist believed that Palpatine would be found alive Palpatine also appears frequently in the comic book series Darth Vader Dark Lord of the Sith written by Kieron Gillen and Charles Soule It is suggested at the end of the series that Palpatine manipulated the Force to impregnate Vader s mother Shmi Skywalker making him in essence Vader s father although this is left somewhat ambiguous This builds on the plot point of Anakin s virgin birth introduced in The Phantom Menace and the indication that a Sith Lord could use the Force to influence the midi chlorians to create life as Palpatine tells Anakin in Revenge of the Sith In the rough draft of the latter film Palpatine explicitly tells Anakin that he used the power of the Force to will the midichlorians to start the cell divisions that conceived him Video games Star Wars Battlefront II adds a canonical tale spanning the destruction of the second Death Star through the events of The Force Awakens The story takes an Imperial perspective following an elite squadron known as Inferno Squad led by protagonist Iden Versio as they help to execute Operation Cinder following the Emperor s death Operation Cinder was carried out by the Galactic Empire as a means of devastating several Imperial planets a few weeks after the Battle of Endor The operation was part of the Contingency a plan devised by Emperor Palpatine to ensure that the Empire and its enemies would not outlive him should he perish The plan was put into action following the Emperor s death during the Battle of Endor Legends In April Lucasfilm rebranded most of the licensed Star Wars novels and comics produced since the originating film Star Wars as Star Wars Legends and declared them non canon to the franchise Star Wars Legends literature elaborates on Palpatine s role in Star Wars fiction outside of the films Television Chancellor Palpatine in Star Wars Clone Wars Palpatine Darth Sidious is a central character in Genndy Tartakovsky s Star Wars Clone Wars micro series which is set between

novelization of The Phantom Menace Star Wars writers chronicled the role of Palpatine prior to A New Hope as a politician and Sith Lord The comic Marked by Rob Williams printed in Star Wars Tales and Michael Reaves novel Darth Maul Shadow Hunter explain Darth Sidious relationship with his apprentice Darth Maul Cloak of Deception by James Luceno follows Reaves novel and details how Darth Sidious encourages the Trade Federation to build an army of battle droids in preparation for the invasion of Naboo Cloak of Deception also focuses on Palpatine s early political career revealing how he becomes a confidante of Chancellor Finis Valorum and acquainted with Padm Amidala newly elected queen of Naboo Palpatine s role during the Clone Wars as Chancellor of the Republic and Darth Sidious is portrayed in novels such as Matthew Stover s Shatterpoint Steven Barnes The Cestus Deception Sean Stewart s Yoda Dark Rendezvous and Luceno s Labyrinth of Evil and Darth Plagueis Following the theatrical release of Revenge of the Sith Star Wars literature focused on Palpatine s role after the creation of the Empire John Ostrander s comic Star Wars Republic Loyalties chronicles how shortly after seizing power Emperor Palpatine sends Darth Vader to assassinate Sagoro Autem an Imperial captain who plans to defect from the Empire In Luceno s novel Dark Lord The Rise of Darth Vader set shortly after Revenge of the Sith the Emperor sends Darth Vader to the planet Murkhana to discover why clone troopers there refused to carry out Order against their Jedi generals Palpatine hopes these early missions will teach Vader what it means to be a Sith and crush any remnants of Anakin Skywalker Characteristics The Emperor in the original version of The Empire Strikes Back portrayed by Marjorie Eaton and voiced by Clive Revill In Star Wars fiction Palpatine is a cunning politician a ruthless emperor and an evil Sith Lord The Star Wars Databank describes him as the supreme ruler of the most powerful tyrannical regime the galaxy had ever witnessed and Stephen J Sansweet s Star Wars Encyclopedia calls him evil incarnate As a senator Palpatine is unassuming yet ambitious In Cloak of Deception James Luceno writes that Palpatine carefully guards his privacy and others found his reclusiveness intriguing as if he led a secret life Despite this he has many allies in the government Luceno writes What Palpatine lacked in charisma he made up for in candor and it was that directness that had led to his widespread appeal in the senate For in his heart he judged the universe on his own terms with a clear sense of right and wrong In Terry Brooks novelization of The Phantom Menace Palpatine claims to embrace democratic principles He tells Queen Amidala I promise Your Majesty if I am elected chancellor of the Republic I will restore democracy to the Republic I will put an end to the corruption that has plagued the Senate A Visual Dictionary states that he is a self proclaimed savior As Emperor however Palpatine abandons any semblance of democracy as noted in A New Hope when he abolishes the Imperial Senate Sansweet states His Empire is based on tyranny Revenge of the Sith implies that Palpatine was the apprentice of Darth Plagueis while later Expanded Universe materials say explicitly that he was Palpatine is characterized as the most powerful practitioner of the Sith ways in modern times Palpatine is so powerful that he is able to mask his true identity from the Jedi for decades In the novel Shatterpoint Mace Windu remarks to Yoda A shame Palpatine can t touch the Force He might have been a fine Jedi The Star Wars Databank explains that the Force granted him inhuman dexterity and speed agility enough to quickly kill three Jedi Masters as depicted in Revenge of the Sith Stover describes the duel between Yoda and Palpatine in his novelization of Revenge of the Sith thus From the shadow of a black wing a small weapon slid into a withered hand and spat a flame colored blade When the blades met it was more than Yoda against Palpatine more the millennia of Sith against the legions of Jedi this was the expression of the fundamental conflict of the universe itself Light against dark Winner take all During the duel Yoda realizes that Sidious is a superior warrior and represents a small but powerful Sith Order that had changed and evolved over the years while the Jedi had not He had lost before he started He had lost before he was born According to the Databank and New Essential Guide to Characters Palpatine possesses great patience and his maneuverings are as a dejarik grandmaster moves pieces on a board He is depicted as a diabolical genius Palpatine was not given a first name in any canonical or Star Wars Legends sources until when the character s first name Sheev was revealed in the novel Tarkin written by James Luceno The Lucasfilm Story Group approached Del Rey Books and asked if they wanted to use the name which was created by George Lucas in the Tarkin novel to which Del Rey agreed Character creation Lucas conceptualization of Palpatine and the role the character plays in Star Wars changed over time From Return of the Jedi onwards Palpatine became the ultimate personification of evil in Star Wars replacing Darth Vader as the central villain When the original Star Wars trilogy was filmed the Emperor was unnamed and his throne world unidentified The name would not be used in film until the prequel trilogy and the first mention of the name Palpatine came from the prologue of Alan Dean Foster s novelization of A New Hope which detailed the Emperor s rise to power Foster writes Aided and abetted by restless power hungry individuals within the government and the massive organs of commerce the ambitious Senator Palpatine caused himself to be elected President of the Republic He promised to reunite the disaffected among the people and to restore the remembered glory of the Republic Once secure in office he declared himself Emperor shutting himself away from the populace Soon he was controlled by the very assistants and boot lickers he had appointed to high office and the cries of the people for justice did not reach his ears However it is unclear whether Lucas intended Palpatine to be the reigning Emperor or just the first of a succession of Emperors Michael Kaminski author of The Secret History of Star Wars claims that Lucas initial notes discuss a line of corrupt emperors not just one If Palpatine was the first Kaminski infers he would therefore not be the current Later Lucas would abandon this idea opting instead to focus on a sole villainous ruler During story conferences for The Empire Strikes Back Lucas and Leigh Brackett decided that the Emperor and the Force had to be the two main concerns in the film the Emperor had barely been dealt with in the first movie and the intention in the sequel was to deal with him on a more concrete level Lucas ultimately decided instead to feature the Emperor in Return of the Jedi U S President Richard Nixon was an influence in the development of the Palpatine character In that film the initial conception of Palpatine was superseded by his depiction as a dictatorial ruler adept in the dark side of the Force The Emperor was inspired by the villain Ming the Merciless from the Flash Gordon comic books The characterization of Palpatine as an ambitious and ruthless politician dismantling a democratic republic to achieve supreme power is in part inspired by the real world examples of Julius Caesar Napoleon Bonaparte and Adolf Hitler Other elements of the character come from Richard Nixon c Lucas said that Nixon s presidency got me to thinking historically about how do democracies get turned into dictatorships Because the democracies aren t overthrown they re given away Lucas also said The whole point of the movies the underlying element that makes the movies work is that you whether you go backwards or forwards you start out in a democracy and democracy turns into a dictatorship and then the rebels make it back into a democracy Lucas wanted to establish the Emperor as the true source of evil in Star Wars Screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan noted My sense of the relationship between Darth Vader and the Emperor is that the Emperor is much more powerful and that Vader is very much intimidated by him Vader has dignity but the Emperor in Jedi really has all the power He explained that the climax of the film is a confrontation between Darth Vader and his master In the first scene that shows the Emperor he arrives at the Death Star and is greeted by a host of stormtroopers technicians and other personnel Lucas states he wanted it to look like the military parades on May Day in Russia Lucas fleshed out the Emperor in the prequel films According to Lucas Palpatine s role in The Phantom Menace is to explain how Anakin Skywalker came to be Palpatine s apprentice and the events that led to his rise to power According to film critic Jonathan L Bowen Debates raged on the Internet concerning the relationship between Darth Sidious and Senator Palpatine Most fans believed the two characters are actually the same person with logic seeming to support their conclusion Bowen notes that the debate was fueled by the fact that suspiciously Darth Sidious does not appear in the credits Augustus in the robes and cloak of his position as Pontifex Maximus In Star Wars and History published by Lucasfilm it describes Palpatine s consolidation of power as being similar to the Roman political figure Augustus Both legitimized authoritarian rule by saying that corruption in the Senate was hampering the powers of the head of state both pressured the Senate to grant extraordinary powers to deal with a crisis falsely claiming that they would rescind those powers once the crisis was over and both relied on their strong control over military force Portrayal When the Emperor first appeared in The Empire Strikes Back he was portrayed by Marjorie Eaton under heavy makeup Chimpanzee eyes were superimposed into darkened eye sockets during post production in order to create a truly unsettling image The character was voiced by Clive Revill The makeup was sculpted by Phil Tippett and applied by Rick Baker who initially used his own wife Elaine for the makeup tests With director Irvin Kershner Revill said you had to keep the reins tight you couldn t go overboard It was the perfect example of the old adage less is more the Emperor doesn t say very much But when he finally appears it s at a point in the saga when everyone s waiting to see him It s the Emperor the arch villain of all time and when he says there s a great disturbance in the Force I mean that s enough oomph Years later during production of Revenge of the Sith Lucas decided to shoot new footage for The Empire Strikes Back to create continuity between the prequels and original trilogy Thus in the DVD release of The Empire Strikes Back Special Edition the original version of the Emperor was replaced by Scottish Shakespearean actor Ian McDiarmid and the dialogue between the Emperor and Darth Vader was revised Lucas and director Richard Marquand cast McDiarmid to play Emperor Palpatine for Return of the Jedi He was in his late s and had never played a leading role in a feature film though he had made minor appearances in films like Dragonslayer After Return of the Jedi he resumed stage acting in London In an interview with BackStage McDiarmid revealed that he never had his sights set on a film career and never even auditioned for the role of Palpatine He elaborated I got called in for the interview after a Return of the Jedi casting director saw me perform in the Sam Shepard play Seduced at a studio theatre at the Royal Court I was playing a dying Howard Hughes McDiarmid was surprised when Lucas approached him years after Return of the Jedi to reprise the role of Palpatine In an interview he stated When we were doing Return of the Jedi there was a rumor that George Lucas had nine films in his head and he d clearly just completed three of them McDiarmid added Someone said that Oh I think what he might do next is go back in time and show how Vader came to be It never occurred to me in a million years that I would be involved in that because I thought oh well then he ll get a much younger actor to play Palpatine That would be obvious However I was the right age ironically for the first prequel when it was made So I was in the very strange and rather wonderful paradox of playing myself when young at my own age having played myself previously when and I don t know what Palpatine s role in the prequel films required McDiarmid to play two dimensions of the same character Recalling the initial days of shooting The Phantom Menace McDiarmid stated Stepping onto the set of Episode I for the first time was like going back in time due to my experience in Jedi Palpatine s an interesting character he s conventional on the outside but demonic on the inside he s on the edge trying to go beyond what s possible McDiarmid added another layer to the character in Attack of the Clones He noted Palpatine is a supreme actor He has to be even more convincing than somebody who isn t behaving in a schizophrenic fashion so he s extra charming or extra professional and for those who are looking for clues that s almost where you can see them McDiarmid illuminated on the scene where Padm Amidala is almost assassinated There s a moment in one scene of the new film where tears almost appear in his eye These are crocodile tears but for all those in the movie and perhaps watching the movie itself they ll see he is apparently moved and of course he is He can just do it He can as it were turn it on And I suppose for him it s also a bit of a turn on the pure exercise of power is what he s all about That s the only thing he s interested in and the only thing that can satisfy him which makes him completely fascinating to play because it is an evil soul He is more evil than the devil At least Satan fell he has a history and it s one of revenge In Revenge of the Sith McDiarmid played a darker interpretation of the character He explained that when you re playing a character of solid blackness that in itself is very interesting in the sense that you have no other motivation other than the accumulation of power It s not so much about not having a moral center it s just that the only thing that mattered is increasing power He admitted I ve been trying to find a redeeming feature to Palpatine and the only one I ve got so far is that he s clearly a patron of the arts because he goes to the opera McDiarmid compared the character to Iago from William Shakespeare s Othello Everything he does is an act of pure hypocrisy and that s interesting to play I suppose it s rather like playing Iago All the characters in the play including Othello until the end think that Honest Iago is a decent guy doing his job and he s quite liked But at the same time there s a tremendous evil subconscious in operation McDiarmid noticed that the script for Revenge of the Sith demanded more action from his character than in previous films Lightsaber combat was a challenge to the year old actor who like his costars took fencing lessons The close up shots and non acrobatic sequences of the duel between Palpatine and Mace Windu were performed by McDiarmid Advanced fencing and acrobatic stunts were executed by McDiarmid s doubles Michael Byrne Sebastian Dickins and Bob Bowles McDiarmid s performance as Palpatine was generally well received by critics Todd McCarthy of Variety commented Entertaining from start to finish and even enthralling at times Sith has some acting worth writing home about specifically McDiarmid s dominant turn as the mastermind of the evil empire Ed Halter of The Village Voice wrote that Ian McDiarmid s unctuous Emperor turns appropriately vampiric as he attempts to draw Anakin into the Sith fold with promises of eternal life Still his performance was not without detractors David Edelstein of Slate critiqued McDiarmid isn t the subtlest of satanic tempters With his lisp and his clammy little leer he looks like an old queen keen on trading an aging butt boy Count Dooku for fresh meat which leaves Anakin looking more and more like a watt bulb McDiarmid had expressed interest in reprising the role of Palpatine in the planned Star Wars Underworld TV series which remains un produced but according to Cory Barlog would have depicted the character as a sympathetic figure who was wronged by this fucking heartless woman She s this hardcore gangster and she just totally destroyed him as a person Make up and costumes Chancellor Palpatine s robes from Episode III Transforming McDiarmid into Emperor Palpatine in Return of the Jedi required extensive makeup McDiarmid remarked in an interview with Star Wars Insider Yes that was a four hour job initially although we got it down to about two and a half in the end But this was just a little bit of latex here and there a little bit of skin scrunching Film critic Roger Ebert wrote that the Emperor looks uncannily like Death in The Seventh Seal and film historian Robin Wood compares him to the hag from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs McDiarmid remarked When my face changes in Revenge of the Sith my mind went back to the early silent movie of The Phantom of the Opera with Lon Chaney Conversely he required little makeup in The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones He recalled I m slightly aged in AotC In the last film I had a fairly standard make up on but now they re starting to crinkle my face Palpatine s wardrobe in the prequels tailored by costume designer Trisha Biggar played an important part in the development of the character In Attack of the Clones explained McDiarmid The costumes have got much more edge to them I think than the mere senator had in The Phantom Menace So we see the trappings of power On Revenge of the Sith McDiarmid said that To wear the costumes as the character I play is wonderfully empowering McDiarmid s favorite costume in the film was a high collared jacket that resembles snake or lizard skin He stated that it just feels reptilian which is exactly right for Palpatine According to Biggar the character s costumes proved the most daunting challenge She said His six costumes get progressively darker and more ornately decorated throughout the movie He wears greys and browns almost going to black taking him toward the dark side In popular culture With the premiere of Return of the Jedi and the prequel films and the accompanying merchandising campaign Palpatine became an icon in American popular culture Kenner Hasbro produced and marketed a series of action figures of the character from to According to John Shelton Lawrence and Robert Jewett These action figures allow children up to handle the symbols of the Force Academics have debated the relationship of Palpatine to modern culture Religion scholars Ross Shepard Kraemer William Cassidy and Susan Schwartz compare Palpatine and Star Wars heroes to the theological concept of dualism They insist One can certainly picture the evil emperor in Star Wars as Satan complete with his infernal powers leading his faceless minions such as his red robed Imperial Guards Lawrence and Jewett argue that Vader killing Palpatine in Return of the Jedi represented the permanent subduing of evil Since Return of the Jedi and the prequel films Palpatine s name has been invoked as a caricature in politics A Seattle Post Intelligencer editorial noted that anti pork bloggers were caricaturing West Virginia Senator Robert Byrd as the Emperor Palpatine of pork with Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska having clear aspirations to be his Darth Vader The charge followed a report that linked a secret hold on the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of to the two senators Politicians have made comparisons as well In Democratic Senator Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey compared Republican Majority Leader Bill Frist of Tennessee to Palpatine in a speech on the Senate floor complete with a visual aid A Fox News editorial stated no cultural icon can exist without someone trying to stuff it into a political ideology The Star Wars saga the greatest pop culture icon of the last three decades is no exception Palpatine s dissolution of the Senate in favor of imperial rule has been compared to Julius Caesar s marginalization of the Roman Senate Hitler s power grab as chancellor and FDR s court packing scheme and creation of the imperial presidency On the Internet After Disney s purchase of Lucasfilm in and the sequel trilogy s success in the mid late s the character became the subject of various internet memes emphasizing certain lines of dialogue the character spoke in Star Wars Revenge of the Sith References Footnotes DVD and subsequent releases of Episode V Created from an archival source In his early drafts Lucas used the plot point of a dictator staying in power with the support of the military In his comment made in the prequel trilogy era Lucas attributed this to Nixon s supposed intention to defy the nd Amendment but the president was actually impeached and never ran for a third term Fellow Republican
